Although above work can be performed without removing existing bead board
siding and installing a firm plywood base, above method is highly
recommeneded  for a more water tight, more secure, and visually pleasing
end result. 


The cost of doing this job by going over existing wainscoting boards and
installed insulation board--but still installing all critical flashings
would be $15,000.00.
