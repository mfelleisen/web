Racket, a functional language in the Lisp family, promotes a language-oriented
style of programming. Developers create many domain-specific languages, write
programs in those, and compose these programs via Racket code. This style of
programming can work only if creating and composing little languages is simple
and effective. This talk will take demonstrate how Racket achieves this goal,
starting from bare-bones functional code and moving through a range of
examples from classical research (Algol '60) to modern end-point programming
for the Web.
