Racket, a functional language in the Lisp family, promotes a language-oriented
style of programming. Developers create many domain-specific languages, write
programs in those, and compose these programs via Racket code. This style of
programming can work only if creating and composing little languages is simple
and effective. This talk will demonstrate how Racket achieves this goal,
first with an overview of an extensive case study, followed by a hands-on
demonstration with a small example.  Time permitting, I will explain the
current state of this research.
