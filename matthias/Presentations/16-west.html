Whether you checked the weather app or not on the day before
22 Jan 2016, a huge snow storm covered the Eastern United
States that weekend.  If you lived in New York or DC, you had
to dig out from under a large load of snow the next morning. 

In the face of such storms, the good news is that people have
almost perfected the art of weather prediction over the past
few decades. A snow storm or hurricane will no longer catch
anyone by surprise. If we act on these predictions in time,
we can easily prevent the bad disasters of the days gone by.

My keynote will expand on this theme. Bring an umbrella.
