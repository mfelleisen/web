            "Functional C"                                         dimensions of FPLs: 
	    							   pure (Haskell) vs impure (OCAML)
                                                                   typed (SML) vs untyped (Scheme) % always safe
								   common VM (F#) vs special VM (Racket)

                                  embedded domain-specific languages
				    often declarative (layout manager in Swing),
				    functional (???), or
				    functional-reactive (GS's trading language)



Anonymous programmer, 25 Sept 2011:
"Unfortunately, most of the time I am not actually programming, rather, I am
obliged to "mend" lousy, poorly documented (if at all) code others have
done - functions of 1000+ lines, huge unreadable SQL stored procedures
written by hardly competent, uninterested "programmers" are my daily "stone
of Sisyphus".

"In addition, I see too many people that did not improve much through
programming for more than 20 years."
