The creation of a programming language calls for guiding
principles that point the developers to goals. This talk spells out the
three basic principles behind the 20-year development of Racket. Expressed
as slogans, we say that 
<ol>
<li> Racket is a programming-language programming language </li>
<li> Racket is a full-stack programming language </li>
<li> Racket is a linguist's programming language </li> 
</ol>
First, programming is about stating and solving problems, and this activity
normally takes place in a context with its own language of discourse; good
programmers ought to formulate this language as a programming
language. Hence, <em>Racket is a programming language for creating new
programming languages.</em> Second, by following this language-oriented
approach to programming, systems become multi-lingual collections of
interconnected components. Each language and component must be able to
protect its specific invariants. In support, <em>Racket offers protection
mechanisms to implement a full language stack</em>, from C-level bit
manipulation to soundly typed extensions. Third, because Racket considers
programming as problem solving in the correct language, <em>Racket also
turns extra-linguistic mechanisms into linguistic constructs</em>, especially
mechanisms for managing resources and projects. The paper explains these
principles and how Racket lives up to them, presents the evaluation
framework behind the design process, and concludes with a sketch of
Racket's imperfections and opportunities for future improvements.
