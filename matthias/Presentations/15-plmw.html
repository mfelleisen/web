This talk presents a personal reflection on how I shaped my research
program over three decades and how these lessons may apply to a beginning
PhD student. I explain what my long-term projects look like and how they
came about.  In this context I discuss and illustrate two scenarios for the
development of a research program for a new graduate student. First, the
student can find a topic that closely relates to some current PhD student's
work and contribute to this work. Doing so will naturally lead to ideas for
a dissertation. Second, if a student comes with pre-shaped ideas, the
situation calls for mutual education so that the advisor can figure out the
landscape and help the student set up a research program.
