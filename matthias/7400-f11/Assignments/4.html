<blockquote>
<p> 
  The goal of this problem set is to understand the basics of the Lambda
  calculus as a computing system and to increase your familiarity with
  Redex's testing facilities. 
</p>
</blockquote>

<p><b>Problem 1</b>:</p>
<blockquote>

 <p>
  The goal of this exercise is to equip the calculational model of
  arithmetic from class with three additional operations: <code>-</code>,
  <code>*</code>, <code>if0</code>: 
<pre><code>  (define-language Expressions
    (e n
       (e + e)
       (e * e)
       (e - e)
       (e / e)
       error
       x
       (if0 e e e))
    (n number))
</code></pre>
 The interpretation of the operations is the obvious one. In particular, an
 <code>if0</code> expression reduces to the second sub-expression if its
  first one reduces to <code>0</code> and to the third sub-expression
  otherwise. 
</p>

<p>
  Also the model comes with <code>error</code> so that your model can deal
  with division by 0. Specifically, your model should reduce expressions
  such as <code>(1 / 0)</code> to <code>error</code>, and operations that
  encounter <code>error</code> should propagate it, e.g., <code>(1 +
  error)</code> should reduce to <code>error</code>. 
</p>

<p>
  The variable <code>x</code> is to remain uninterpreted. It serves as a
  reminder that this kind of expression language could appear as a part of
  a full-fledged programming language. 
 </p>

<p>
 Equip the model with a collection of test reductions that show that the terms
 are reduced to normal form. Since testing reductions is a common activity
 for semantics engineers, Redex comes with appropriate constructs. See
 documentation. 
</p>

</blockquote>


<p><b>Background for Problems 2 through 4</b>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
All remaining problems in this assignment refer to this core grammar: 
<pre><code>  (define-language Lambda0
    (e x
       (lambda (x) e)
       (e e))
    (x variable-not-otherwise-mentioned))
</code></pre>

 This language is defined and exported from the library module
 <a href="4provided.rkt"><code>"4provided.rkt"</code></a>. In addition to the
 language, the module provides a capture-avoiding substitution function, 
 <code>subst-n</code>. 

 Save the module under its given name and add 

<pre><code>  (require "4provided.rkt")</code></pre> 
 to your solution file. Do not modify the module. Program to its interface
 only. 
</p>
</blockquote>



<p><b>Problem 2</b>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
 In contrast to the text book, this homework explores the lambda calculus
 model modulo &alpha;-equivalence, an idea that is spelled out in chapter
 I.4 of the text book.
</p>

<p>Here is a definition of a Racket function that determines whether two
  terms in <code>Lambda0</code> are indeed &alpha;-equivalent: 
<pre><code>  ;; e[Lambda0] e[Lambda0] -&gt; Boolean 
  ;; are t1 and t2 alpha equivalent?
  (define (alpha= t1 t2)
    (define sd1 (term (sd ,t1)))
    (define sd2 (term (sd ,t2)))
    (equal? sd1 sd2))
</code></pre>
 It assumes the definition of the function <code>sd</code>, which
 translates a <code>Lambda0</code> term into the so-called
 "static distance" notation of <a href="1.html#five">problem set 1, problem
 5</a>. In class, this form is referred to as the "arrow" form of terms. 
</p>

<p>
 Design the <code>sd</code> function and all necessary auxiliaries in
 Redex. <emph>Do not escape to Racket for any reason.</emph>
 In addition to replacing bound variables into static distance
 numbers, the function must also change all parameters to <code>dummy</code>
 or some other fixed name. Doing so is legitimate because parameter names
 no longer play a role in static-distance notation. It enables the simple
 comparison via <code>equal?</code> in <code>alpha=</code> above. 
</p>
</blockquote>


<p><b>Problem 3</b>:</p>

<blockquote>

<p> 
 Develop a Redex model of the lambda &beta; calculus. 
 That is, the model should use &beta; as the only notion of reduction. 
</p> 

<p>
 Demonstrate with three reduction tests that the model can reduce
 <code>Lambda0</code> to normal form, i.e., to terms that do not contain a
 &beta; redex. At least one of the tests must demonstrate that doing so may
 require several steps. Another test must demonstrate that you can predict
 the outcome only up to &alpha; equivalence.
</p>
</blockquote>


<p><b>Problem 4</b>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p> 
 Implement the stacks from <a href="2.html">problem set 2</a> via
 <code>Lambda0</code> expressions. Do <em>not</em> use recursion, i.e., 
 the Y combinator. Instead use the OO-encoding model. 
</p>

<p>
 Demonstrate with reduction tests that the expressions implement the
 reduction laws of stacks for concrete examples. Note: when I worked
 through this exercise, I had to disable 'debugging' in DrRacket to get
 decent performance. I only did so <em>after</em> debugging the model of course.
