<blockquote>
<p> 

 The goal of this problem set is to practice structurally recursive
 programming and using inductive proofs.  

</p>

<p>

 Use the <strong> Redex</strong> programming language for all programming
 problems. 

</p>

<p><b>WARNING:</b> This problem set is labor-intensive for those of you who
  have little or no practice with structural programming. <em>Start early.</em>
  Do not for one moment believe, however, that this problem set is
  difficult because it requires you to solve the problems in a new
  language. If you have this impression, solve the problem in your favorite
  programming language and show me your solution.

<a name="1"><p><b>Problem 1</b>:</p></a>

<blockquote>
<p>
 Develop a data representation for a mobile. Wikipedia describes
 a moible as follows: 
   <blockquote>
   A mobile is a type of kinetic sculpture constructed to take advantage of
   the principle of equilibrium. It consists of a number of rods, from which
   weighted objects or further rods hang. The objects hanging from the rods
   balance each other, so that the rods remain more or less horizontal. Each
   rod hangs from only one string, which gives it freedom to rotate about the
   string. 
</blockquote>
 Here is a rigorous, structured description, similar to the grammars found
 in the Java language specification: 
 <blockquote>
 A <em>Mobile</em> is one of: 
  <ul>
   <li>a Weight</li>
   <li>a combination of two Mobiles and a weight. </li>
  </ul>

 A <em>Weight</em> is a natural number (0, 1, 2, ...). 
 <br />
 Interpretation: The weight in the first case represents an "atomic"
 sculpture. You may represent a weight as a plain number, say the number of
 "kg" that the sculpture weighs. The weight in the second case is a
 pointwise approximation of the beam that connects the two Mobiles.

 </blockquote>
</p>

<p> Design the following functions: 
<ol>
<li>
 <tt>weights#</tt>, which consumes a mobile and counts the number of atomic
 sculptures it contains;  
</li>

<li>
 <tt>total-weight</tt>, which consumes a mobile and determines its total
 weight;  
</li>

<li>
 <tt>average-weight</tt>, which consumes a mobile and determines the
 average of its weight over all the atomic sculptures it contains;  
</li>

<li>
 <tt>depth</tt>, which consumes a mobile and determines the maximal number
 of links from the top of the mobile to one of its atomic sculptures;
</li>

<li>
 <tt>balanced?</tt>, which consumes a mobile and determines whether or not
 it is balanced. A mobile is balanced if the weight of the mobile on one
 end is equal to the weight of the mobile on the other end. The weight of a
 mobile naturally includes the beams. 
</li>
</ol>
</p>
</blockquote>


<a name="2"><p><b>Problem 2</b>:</p></a>

<blockquote>
 <p>
 Recall the data definition for S-expressions over strings:
  <blockquote>
   <pre>
   (define-language Sexpr
     (s string
	(s ...)))
   </pre>
  </blockquote>
 For this problem, we ignore the interpretation of this data representation. 
 </p>

<p>Design the following functions: 
 <ol>
  <li><tt>count</tt>, which counts the number of <font color="red">string</font>s in an S-expression;</li>
  <li><tt>flatten</tt>, which produces the list of all <font color="red">string</font>s in an
    S-expression (duplicates allowed)</li> 
  <li><tt>substitute</tt>, which replaces some <tt>old</tt> <font color="red">string</font> with a
    <tt>new</tt> <font color="red">string</font> in the given S-expression.</li>
 </ol>
</p>
</blockquote>


<p><b>Problem 3</b>:</p>

<blockquote>
 Design the function <tt>silly</tt>. The function consumes a Mobile (see
 Problem 1). It produces a Mobile, by adding to each sculpture <tt>S</tt>
 (remember that it is represented by its weight) the depth of <tt>S</tt> in
 the Mobile. 
</blockquote>


<p><b>Problem 4</b>:</p>

<blockquote>Prove that
 <ol>
  <li>
    for all mobiles <tt>m</tt>, <tt>total-weight(m) <font color="red">&ge;</font> average-weight(m)</tt>
    <br /> (see <a href="./1.html#1">problem 1</a>)
  </li> 
  <li>
    for all S-expressions <tt>s</tt> and strings <tt>o</tt> and <tt>n</tt>, 
    <br /><tt>substitute(o,n,flatten(s)) = flatten(substitute(o,n,s))</tt>
    <br /> (see <a href="./1.html#2">problem 2</a>)
  </li>
 </ol>
</blockquote>


<a name="five"><p><b>Problem 5</b>:</p></a>

<blockquote>
<p>
 Design the function <tt>sd</tt>. It consumes an expression of the
 following language
 <blockquote>
  An <em>XY</em> is one of: 
  <ul>
    <li><tt>Variable</tt></li>
    <li><tt>(function Variable XY)</tt></li>
    <li><tt>(XY XY)</tt></li>
  </ul>
 </blockquote>
 and produces one this shape: 
 <blockquote>
  An <em>AB</em> is one of: 
  <ul>
    <li>a <tt>Number</tt></li>
    <li>a <tt>Variable</tt></li>
    <li><tt>(function Variable AB)</tt></li>
    <li><tt>(AB AB)</tt></li>
  </ul>
 </blockquote>
 In both cases, 
 <blockquote>
  A <em>Variable</em> is a name drawn from the set <tt>x</tt>, <tt>y</tt>, ...
 </blockquote>
 which is disjoint from the set of Numbers. 
</p>

<p>
 For each variable introduced by the first clause in an <tt>XY</tt> expression, 
 <tt>sd</tt> replaces it with the number of <tt>function</tt> nodes between 
 it and the closest <tt>function</tt> node that comes the same variable. If 
 there is no such node, the symbol is transferred to the output. 
</p>

 <p>For example, when given 
<pre>
        (function y
	  ((function x 
	     (x y))
	    (x y)))
</pre>
  <tt>sd</tt> produces 
<pre>
        (function y
	  ((function x 
	     (0 1))
	    (x 0)))
</pre>
 </p>

<strong>Note</strong>: This problem is already a true exercise in modeling
programming languages. It looks challenging and is the most complex
exercise of this problem set, but given that you are PhD students, it
should be well within reach.
