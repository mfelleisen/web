<p>The book, written in the style of <a href = "../BTLS">The Little
Schemer,</a> covers the essence of class-based, object-oriented programming
in Java. It uses a data-driven approach that naturally leads to the use of
object-oriented design patterns like the interpreter pattern, the composite
pattern, the visitor pattern, and the factory method pattern. Enjoy!</p>
