The fabric teachpack provides the following images and functions.  The
color arguments should be symbols of color names (such as 'red or
'teal).  The list of known colors is huge and includes all the
standard color names.

FUNCTIONS

  ;; white-image : number number -> image
  ;; produces a white (blank) image with given width and height
  
  ;; create-solid-fabric : color image -> image
  ;; produces solid color image of same size as given image
  
  ;; create-print-fabric : image image -> image
  ;; produces tiles of first image to match size of second image 
 
  ;; create-horiz-stripe-fabric : color number image -> image
  ;; produces image with horiz stripes of given color and width of given image size
  
  ;; create-vertical-stripe-fabric : color number image -> image
  ;; produces image with vertical stripes of given color and width of given image size
  
  ;; add-print : image image -> image
  ;; overlays tiles of first image onto second image 
  
  ;; add-horiz-stripe : color number image -> image
  ;; overlays horizontal stripe of given color and height on given image
  
  ;; add-vertical-stripe : color number image -> image
  ;; overlays vertical stripe of given color and width on given image 

  ;; move-pinhole-to image integer integer -> image
  ;; returns given image with pinhole at given x and y coordinates 
   
  ;; move-pinhole-center : image -> image
  ;; returns given image with pinhole at image center

  ;; move-pinhole-topleft : image -> image
  ;; returns given image with pinhole at top left corner (0,0)

Note: the functions for moving pinholes are useful for the
stack-logos and side-by-side-logos exercises.  DrScheme's overlay-xy
function leaves the pinhole as that of the first image; it does not
center the pinhole on the combined image.  Centering the pinhole on
these logos problems makes it easier to add a combined logo to a
clothing item.
