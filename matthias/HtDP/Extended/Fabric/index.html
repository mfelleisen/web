    <h1>Early Exercise with Images: Making Fabric and Clothing</h1>
<p>&copy; Kathi Fisler, 2004


<p>This exercise has students create images of fabrics, create
      clothing items from fabrics, and put logos onto clothing items.
      It is designed to give students practice composing
      functions.</p>

<p><b>Prerequisites:</b> Numbers, Functions, Images, Defining
      Constants (<a

<p><b>Note to Teachers from Providence 2004 Workshop:</b> this version
differs slightly from the one we used in the workshop:

<ul>
  <li>the basic shirt image is on a tan background (avoids confusion
    that the seemingly white background from the original image wasn't
    really white)

  <li> there's now a hat image
  
  <li> the backgrounds on the flower, worm, and chili images have be
    cleaned up so that there is no longer a white cloud around them.

  <li> In the teachpack for version 208, dye-fabric is currently
	disabled (we're still migrating that to 208) -- you can create
	similar fabrics without it by starting with colored fabrics
	rather than dying fabrics later.
</ul>
