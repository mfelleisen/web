Sample exercises for the fabric teachpack

1. Using the functions in the teachpack, define three fabrics sized to
fit a tshirt.  Each fabric should involve at least two calls to
functions that create fabric.  Be creative!

2. Write a function create-from-fabric that consumes an image for a
white clothing item and fabric sized to fit that item and produces an
image of the clothing item in the given fabric.

3. Write a function add-center-logo that consumes an image for a logo
and an image for a clothing item and produces an image of the clothing
item with the logo centered on it.  The given clothing item may
already be printed in fabric.

4. Write a function stack-logos that consumes images of two logos and
returns an image with the first logo just above the second logo. You
do not need to center the logos, but you may if you wish.  (Note that
Scheme has a function max that consumes two numbers and produces the
larger of the numbers.)

5. Write a function side-by-side-logos that consumes images of two
logos and returns an image with the first logo to the left of the
second logo. You do not need to center the logos, but you may if you
wish.  

6. Define three pieces of clothing using a combination of the
teachpack functions and your definitions.  You should use each of the
functions you defined at least once.  Again, be creative!
