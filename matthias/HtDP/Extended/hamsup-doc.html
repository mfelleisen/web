((GUILDENSTERN 
  "My honoured lord!")
 (ROSENCRANTZ 
  "My most dear lord!")
 (HAMLET 
  "My excellent good friends! How dost thou,"
  "Guildenstern? Ah, Rosencrantz! Good lads, how do ye both?")
 (ROSENCRANTZ 
  "As the indifferent children of the earth.")
 (GUILDENSTERN 
  "Happy, in that we are not over-happy;"
  "On fortune's cap we are not the very button.")
 (HAMLET
  "Nor the soles of her shoe?")
 (ROSENCRANTZ 
  "Neither, my lord.")
 (HAMLET 
  "Then you live about her waist, or in the middle of"
  "her favours?")
 (GUILDENSTERN 
  "'Faith, her privates we.")
 (HAMLET 
  "In the secret parts of fortune? O, most true; she"
  "is a strumpet. What's the news?")
 (ROSENCRANTZ 
  "None, my lord, but that the world's grown honest.")
 (HAMLET 
  "Then is doomsday near: but your news is not true."
  "Let me question more in particular: what have you,"
  "my good friends, deserved at the hands of fortune,"
  "that she sends you to prison hither?")
 (GUILDENSTERN 
  "Prison, my lord!")
 (HAMLET 
  "Denmark's a prison.")
 (ROSENCRANTZ 
  "Then is the world one.")
 (HAMLET 
  "A goodly one; in which there are many confines,"
  "wards and dungeons, Denmark being one o' the worst.")
 (ROSENCRANTZ 
  "We think not so, my lord.")
 (HAMLET 
  "Why, then, 'tis none to you; for there is nothing"
  "either good or bad, but thinking makes it so: to me"
  "it is a prison.")
 (ROSENCRANTZ 
  "Why then, your ambition makes it one; 'tis too"
  "narrow for your mind.")
 (HAMLET 
  "O God, I could be bounded in a nut shell and count"
  "myself a king of infinite space, were it not that I"
  "have bad dreams.")
 (GUILDENSTERN 
  "Which dreams indeed are ambition, for the very"
  "substance of the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream.")
 (HAMLET 
  "A dream itself is but a shadow.")
 (ROSENCRANTZ 
  "Truly, and I hold ambition of so airy and light a"
  "quality that it is but a shadow's shadow.")
 (HAMLET 
  "Then are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs and"
  "outstretched heroes the beggars' shadows. Shall we"
  "to the court? for, by my fay, I cannot reason.")
 (ROSENCRANTZ
  "We'll wait upon you.")
 (HAMLET 
  "No such matter: I will not sort you with the rest"
  "of my servants, for, to speak to you like an honest"
  "man, I am most dreadfully attended. But, in the"
  "beaten way of friendship, what make you at Elsinore?")
 (ROSENCRANTZ 
  "To visit you, my lord; no other occasion.")
 (HAMLET 
  "Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks; but I"
  "thank you: and sure, dear friends, my thanks are"
  "too dear a halfpenny. Were you not sent for? Is it"
  "your own inclining? Is it a free visitation? Come,"
  "deal justly with me: come, come; nay, speak.")
 (GUILDENSTERN 
  "What should we say, my lord?")
 (HAMLET 
  "Why, any thing, but to the purpose. You were sent"
  "for; and there is a kind of confession in your looks"
  "which your modesties have not craft enough to colour:"
  "I know the good king and queen have sent for you.")
 (ROSENCRANTZ 
  "To what end, my lord?")
 (HAMLET 
  "That you must teach me. But let me conjure you, by"
  "the rights of our fellowship, by the consonancy of"
  "our youth, by the obligation of our ever-preserved"
  "love, and by what more dear a better proposer could"
  "charge you withal, be even and direct with me,"
  "whether you were sent for, or no?")
 (GUILDENSTERN 
  "My lord, we were sent for.")
 (HAMLET 
  "I will tell you why; so shall my anticipation"
  "prevent your discovery, and your secrecy to the king"
  "and queen moult no feather. I have of late--but"
  "wherefore I know not--lost all my mirth, forgone all"
  "custom of exercises; and indeed it goes so heavily"
  "with my disposition that this goodly frame, the"
  "earth, seems to me a sterile promontory, this most"
  "excellent canopy, the air, look you, this brave"
  "o'erhanging firmament, this majestical roof fretted"
  "with golden fire, why, it appears no other thing to"
  "me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours."
  "What a piece of work is a man! how noble in reason!"
  "how infinite in faculty! in form and moving how"
  "express and admirable! in action how like an angel!"
  "in apprehension how like a god! the beauty of the"
  "world! the paragon of animals! And yet, to me,"
  "what is this quintessence of dust? Man delights not"
  "me: no, nor woman neither, though by your smiling"
  "you seem to say so."))
