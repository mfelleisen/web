<p><b>Final submission:</b> The code that you submit on Friday at 5:00pm is
  the code that you will present in your final code walk. You will present
  it on either a lab-style Windows computer or a lab-style Solaris (Unix)
  computer. To ensure that you can present and run your code, you must 
<ul>
<li>CC Alex on your final submission (see Web page for email address)</li>

<li>Specify in your email on which machine you want to present and run your
code</li>

<li>Plead your case with Alex to install software other than the one on the
 lab machines. If you really need such software, you should meet with Alex
 as soon as you can do prepare this installation. 
</li>
</ul></p>

<p><b>Final presentation:</b> Over the weekend you should prepare your
  final presentation of your entire project. The presentations will proceed
  as follows: 
<ul>
<li>You will demo your game. You will run your server; I will connect my
  players to your server.</li>

<li>You will give an overview of the project's goals, the software
  organization that you chose, the data representations, and how the pieces
  interact with each other.</li>

<li>During the Q&amp;A period, we will ask you specific questions about (i) the
  proxy architecture of your project and (ii) anything else that we might
  become interested in.
</li>
</ul>
 So come prepared to explain every aspect of the project.
