People have raised two questions concerning the submission of project 2: 
<ol>
<li><em>Can we use zip files instead of tar files?</em> The answer is "no",
  you really need to turn in tar files. 

  <p>In general, it is terribly important for you to get to know a range of
  technologies---things I can't teach and your boss won't teach you but
  everyone will want you to know. Creating a tar bundle is one such thing.
  A rudimentary understanding of cvs (a version control system) is another
  one. Reading a newsgroup on a regular basis falls into the same
  category. See the <a href="./index.html">homepage</a> for a
  motivation.</p>
</li>

<li><em>What are we to do about the diagrams?</em> You may either use plain
  text diagrams (aka ASCII art) or you can use the tool of your choice and
  generate a jpeg file. I haven't encountered any tool yet that doesn't
  output some graphics file format and finding a filter from that format to
  jpeg is usually a matter of googling.
</li>
</ol>
