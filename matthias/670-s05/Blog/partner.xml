<p>As announced in class today, you must find a new partner by the end of
the week. You and your new partner must choose one of the two code bases
that you worked on as the new code base. </p>

<p><font color="red">Action Item:</font> You must let Sam know via email by
  Friday midnight who your new partner is and which code base you will use
  from here on out. Failure to do so will cost you 10 points on the next
  assignment.
