<p>Over the last ten years, a new promising technology has emerged in academia
that industry is embracing quickly. The new technology, dubbed "aspects", was
co-invented at Northeastern and has a tremendous following in the northeast
corridor. Northeastern is jointly organizing a workshop with Brown to show case
this technology. Please attend two presentations on March 8 instead of class;
your homework for this week is to write a memo to your boss on the two talks,
outlining the two ideas and writing a brief evaluation paragraph. Specifics will
appear on the homework page soon.</p>

I have signed you up collectively. If you have time, I urge you to attend all
talks. It is rare to encounter such a strong collection of speakers from all
over the world in a private workshop for free.
