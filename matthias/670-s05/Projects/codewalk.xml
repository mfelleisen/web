<scheme>(red-title "Presenter")</scheme>

<p>For a presentation of your designs or a code walk, please proceed as
follows:
<ol>

 <li>Concisely restate the task, which points you chose to pursue, and
 which ones you chose to ignore.</li>

 <li>Provide an overview of your solution. For code walks, this includes
 two parts:  
   <ol>

   <li>a (UML class) diagram of the major components and their
    relationships;</li>

   <li>a (UML interaction) diagram that explains the major interactions
    during a program execution.</li>
   </ol>

 In addition, you may have to explain other aspects of the design. 
 
</li>

 <li>Present the components and their functionality in a top-down fashion,
 no matter how you designed and implemented them. Refine as requested. Be
 prepared to defend your code organization, why it matches or doesn't match
 your design. </li>
</ol>

 In general, be prepared to figure out in real time how changes to your
 information/data specification are translated into changes in your program
 organization. 
</p>

<scheme>(generalp "Listener")</scheme>

<p>As a listener, you will play three different roles: 

<ul>
<li>a manager, who is the first "reader" (analyst) and who has the
  responsibility that the presentation stays on track;</li>

<li>an assistant reader, who is the second "code reader";</li>

<li>secretary, who keeps track of the questions that the readers ask, notes
  discoveries of weak spots, and takes notes as needed.</li>
</ul>
When you play "secretary" you are responsible to get a copy of the written
notes to Sam T-H. and the pair within 48 hours.
