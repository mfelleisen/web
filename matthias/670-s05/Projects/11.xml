<hr />


<p><b>Task:</b> Find code duplications in your code and test base and eliminate
them. To do so: create auxiliary functions, private methods, common
superclasses, and so on. [POINTS: 20]</p>

<p><b>Product:</b> Mail a tar bundle with two subdirectories labeled
  <code>YourName_Project9</code> and <code>YourName_Project11</code>. Each
  subdirectory must contain the entire project. The README file for 11 must contain
  one descriptive section per code duplication that you have eliminated from
  your project 8 code base. Your project 9 subdirectory must be identical to the
