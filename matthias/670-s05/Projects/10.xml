<assignment due="3/24 @ 3pm">

<p><b>Objective:</b> to learn to find appropriate patterns</p>

<hr />

<p><b>Task:</b> The goal is to groom some Carcassonne players. Clearly,
every player implements the same general game strategy:

<ol>
<li>find out what the currently available "locations" for the chosen index
  are;</li> 
<li>pick one of those locations;</li>
<li>determine whether to place a follower at all and, if so, where to place
  it</li> 
</ol>

Points 2 and 3 call for "intelligence" that is, for algorithms that
evaluate the chosen locations for tiles and followers. 
</p>

<p>You are to develop at least two such algorithms for steps 2 and 3,
  respectively. This gives you four different kind of players. Naturally,
  you are not allowed to replicate the code in all four players. Instead
  you need to find design patterns in your "dictionary" that help you
  organize these pieces of software properly. [POINTS: 12]
</p>

<p><b>Optional:</b> If you figure out a good organization, it becomes easy
  to "groom" a good player, mixing and matching and even evolving
  strategies as the game proceeds. [POINTS: 5]
</p>

<hr />

<p><b>Product:</b> Mail a tar bundle with a a single subdirectory labeled
  <code>YourName_Project10</code>. The subdirectory must contain your entire
  project. The README file must contain instructions for running and
  visualizing the game [POINTS: 3]; it must also give a brief high-level
  overview of the design patterns you used to arrange your code. If you
  chose to go for the optional points, describe how you did it.
