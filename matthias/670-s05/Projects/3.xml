<assignment due="1/28 @ noon">

<p><b>Objective:</b> to work with someone else's code base and to develop a
  story for a central data structure 
</p>

<hr />

<p>Your first programming project is to modify <a href="Game/"> a program
that comes with comments and test suites</a>. The program implements the
"silly" 21 game that we discussed in <a href="../Lectures/3.html">lecture
3.</a></p>

<p>The given program allows players to roll the die, to skip a turn, or to
declare that they are done. It implements both an automated machine player
and a plain graphical interface to a human player. </p>

<p><b>Task 1:</b> With the given program, a game may last forever. Design and
implement a strategy that guarantees that a game ends. Don't forget to
modify the documentation and the test suites. [POINTS: 5]</p>

<p><b>Task 2:</b> Modify the given program so that a player can optionally roll
the die a second time per turn. Don't forget to modify the documentation
and the test suites. [POINTS: 2]</p>

<hr />

<p>The second half of the assignment is to prepare the term project. The
goal of the project is to implement and maintain <a
href="carcassonne.html">Carcassonne,</a> a board game. As you ponder the
project, keep in mind that eventually we will run the game via a server
into which independent programmers can plug in automated players.</p>

<p><b>Task 3:</b> Identify the central data structure from your use cases
 and write up an interface for this data structure. The interface must
 include interfaces for all arguments and results of functions, and
 definitions for those interfaces. [POINTS: 6] </p>

<p><b>Task 4:</b> Finally, develop a simplistic algorithmic strategy for
 playing the game automatically. Write it up in English. [POINTS: 2] </p>

<hr />

<p><b>Product:</b> Mail a tar bundle with two subdirectories labeled 21 and
  Carcassonne, respectively. Place the relevant pieces into the
  subdirectories and add a README file.
