<p><b>Objective:</b> to extract the essential elements
  from a "project story" 
</p>

<hr />

<p><b>The Story:</b> A small local school offers an "extended day program"
  (EDP), which provides after-school care for children. Parents sign up
  their children for this program at the beginning of the school year but
  the program is flexible. The children show up as needed, and parents can
  pick them up any time during the afternoon program.
</p>

<p>At the end of the month, the school office sends out bills to the
  parents of EDP children. The office bills $8 for each half hour of
  EDP that the children attended.
</p>

<p>Currently, the school uses paper and pencil to keep track of the
  children that attend the program. Each day the teacher receives a sheet
  with the names of the registered children, a check-in column, a check-out
  column, and a signature column. When a child shows up, the EDP
  teacher enters the time in the respective row; when the child leaves,
  the teacher enters the time and the parent initials in the signature
  column. At the end of the month, the office tabulates these entries with
  a computer and creates a bill for each family. 
</p>

<p>Recently some generous (?) parent donated an old computer to the
  school. The principal would now like the EDP teacher to keep track of the
  children via this computer to relieve the office of some of the manual
  and labor-intensive data-entry work.
</p>

<hr /> 

<p><b>Task:</b> Your task is to analyze this story, to describe the
  concepts, to identify the use cases, and to describe those use cases
  informally. [POINTS: 5 total, no partials]
