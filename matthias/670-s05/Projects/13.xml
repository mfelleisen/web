<p><b>Objective:</b> to have a bit of fun with the game </p>

<hr />

<p><b>Task:</b> Set up your client running your designated automated player
  on Saturday morning (April 9) <font color="red">by 11am</font> to look
  for my server on <code>america.ccs.neu.edu</code> at port
  <code>7000</code>. The basic goal is to make it through the first round
  alive. If your player wins this first round, ready it again for a final
  round at noon.</p>

<p>The winning player will get 100 POINTS, the second pair 50, the
  surviving participants of the final round 30, and the surviving
  participants of the first round 20.</p>

<p>Your client should attempt to register with my server on a regular
  basis. <font color="red">The server will gather between two and six
  players (on an almost random basis) and then start one round of the
  game. Each round may last up to 30 minutes, so be prepared that
  your player won't be able to register for a while. You will not get a
  negative answer after the game starts because the server will no longer
  accept connections.</font>
</p>

<p>The final timing specifications are: 
<pre>
  (define max-turn-time         30) ;; seconds 
  (define MAX-REGISTRATION-TIME 3)  ;; seconds 
  (define MAX-RETURN-TIME       3)  ;; seconds 
  ;; signup interval for the player-collecting server 
  (define REG-WAIT              (* 60 10)) ;; 10 minutes
</pre>
