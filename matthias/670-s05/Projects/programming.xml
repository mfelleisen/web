 <scheme>(red-title "Choice of Language")</scheme>

 <p>For in-class demonstrations and discussions, I will use UML diagrams,
 mainstream object-oriented languages such as C# and Java and possibly some
 OO concepts from research languages such as Scheme or scripting languages
 such as Python. </p>

 <p>For projects, you are free to choose whatever language you wish to
 use. You may also switch your language of choice over the course of the
 semester.</p>
