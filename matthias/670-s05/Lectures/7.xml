<h3>Egoless Programming</h3>

<p>Creators naturally invest some of their ego into their
products. Programmers are creators; this is precisely why we are attracted
to this discipline and its professions. Investing an ego, however, often
prevents us from accepting flaws. Criticism of our product is confused with
personal criticism of our person. </p>

<p>People have recognized and understood this problem for a long
  time. Weinberger has suggested considering the notion of "egoless
  programming", i.e., creating programs as if they weren't yours. While
  this is a demanding standard, I request that you divest yourself from
  your product during code walks and that you use this chance to free your
  product from potentially harmful flaws. Keep in mind that this temporary
  "suspension of ego" helps you produce a better product than blind belief
  in yourself.
