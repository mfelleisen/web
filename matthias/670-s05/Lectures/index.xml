 These lecture notes are provided on an ad-hoc basis. I will write them
 when (or if) I have time. My goal is for you to compare these notes with
 your own so that you can determine the quality of your note taking
 abilities. 

<blockquote>
<table>
<splice>
(let ([counter 0]
      [number->file (lambda (x) (format "~a.html" x))])
  (map (lambda (x)
	 (set! counter (+ counter 1))
	 `(tr (td ([align "right"]) ,(number->string counter))
	      (td ([align "left"])
		  (a ([href ,(number->file counter)]) ,x))))
       titles*))
</splice>
