<h2>Worm Hits Microsoft, Which Ignored Own Advice</h2>

<p>
The frantic message came from the corporation's information
technology workers: "HELP NEEDED: If you have servers that
are nonessential, please shut down." 

<p>
The computer system was under attack by a rogue program
called SQL Slammer, which affected servers running
Microsoft software that had not been updated with a patch -
issued months ago - to fix the vulnerability. The worm
hindered the operations of hundreds of thousands of
computers, slowed Internet traffic and even disrupted
thousands of A.T.M. terminals. 

<p>
But this wasn't happening at just any company. It was
occurring at Microsoft itself. Some internal servers were
affected, and service to users of the Microsoft Network was
significantly slowed. 

<p>
The disruption was particularly embarrassing for Microsoft,
which has been preaching the gospel of secure computing. On
Jan. 23, the company's chairman, Bill Gates, sent a memo to
customers describing progress in improving its products
since he announced a "trustworthy computing" initiative a
year ago. 

<p>
"While we've accomplished a lot in the past year, there is
still more to do," he wrote. He cited the hundreds of
millions spent to shore up Microsoft's products, and its
plans to deliver more secure products in the future. He
also listed "things customers can do to help." The first
item was "stay up to date on patches." 

<p>
The paradox was not lost on computer security experts.
"Microsoft has been blaming the users, saying they have to
keep their patches up to date," said Bruce Schneier,
founder and chief technical officer of Counterpane Internet
Security Inc., a company that manages security for
customers. "On the other hand, their own actions
demonstrate how unrealistic that position is." 

<p>
A spokesman for Microsoft, Rick Miller, confirmed that a
number of the company's machines had gone unpatched, and
that Microsoft Network services, like many others on the
Internet, experienced a significant slowdown. "We, like the
rest of the industry, struggle to get 100 percent
compliance with our patch management," he said. 

<p>
"We recognize - now more than ever - that this is something
we need to work on. And, like the rest of the industry,
we're working to fix it."
