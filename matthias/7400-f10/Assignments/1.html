<p> 
  The goal of this problem set is to practice structural programming 
  using structures, lists, S-expressions, recursive data definitions. 
  Some problems demand accumulator-style programming. One of the problems
  is about proof-by-induction, but as you know by now, this is closely
  related to structural programming. 
</p>

<p>
 The problems cover material from HtDP, specifically parts I, II, III, and
 VI. To be reasonable effective in Racket, you also want to read part IV. 
 HtDP is migrating to a second edition; the
 <a href="/home/matthias/HtDP2e/index.html">draft</a> is on-line. 
</p>

<p>
 Use the Racket programming language and the DrRacket programming
 environment to solve the problems (#lang racket).  The appendix of part II
 in your Redex textbook is a nutshell introduction to DrRacket. 

 If you encounter errors you don't understand, you may wish to switch to
 the HtDP Intermediate Student programming language. See the DrRacket
 Language menu. 
</p>

<p><b>WARNING:</b> This problem set is labor-intensive for those of you who
  have little or no practice with structural programming. <em>Start early.</em>
  Do not for one moment believe, however, that this problem set is
  difficult because it requires you to solve the problems in a new
  language. If you have this impression, solve the problem in your favorite
  language and show me your solution.

<p><b>Problem 1</b>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
 Develop a data representation for a mobile. Wikipedia describes
  a moible as follows: 
   <blockquote>
   A mobile is a type of kinetic sculpture constructed to take advantage of
   the principle of equilibrium. It consists of a number of rods, from which
   weighted objects or further rods hang. The objects hanging from the rods
   balance each other, so that the rods remain more or less horizontal. Each
   rod hangs from only one string, which gives it freedom to rotate about the
   string. 
</blockquote>
 We use this rigorous, structured description. A <em>Mobile</em>
  <ul>
   <li>a weight</li>
   <li>a combination of two Mobiles and a weight. </li>
  </ul>
 The weight in the first case represents an "atomic" sculpture. You may
 represent a weight as a plain number, say the number of "kg" that the
 sculpture weighs. The weight in the second case is a pointwise
 approximation of the beam that connects the two Mobiles. 
</p>

<p> Design the following functions: 
<ol>
<li>
 <tt>weights#</tt>, which consumes a mobile and counts the number of
 weights it contains; 
</li>

<li>
 <tt>total-weight</tt>, which consumes a mobile and determines its total
 weight; 
</li>

<li>
 <tt>average-weight</tt>, which consumes a mobile and determines the
 average weight of all the atomic sculptures it contains; 
</li>

<li>
 <tt>depth</tt>, which consumes a mobile and determines the maximal number
 of links from the top of the mobile to one of its atomic sculptures;
</li>

<li>
 <tt>balanced?</tt>, which consumes a mobile and determines whether or not
 it is balanced. A mobile is balanced if the weight of the mobile on one
 end is equal to the weight of the mobile on the other end. The weight of a
 mobile naturally includes the beams. 
</li>
</ol>
</p>
</blockquote>


<p><b>Problem 2</b>:</p>

<blockquote>
 <p>
 Recall the data definition for S-expressions over symbols. An
 <em>S-expression</em> is one of: 
 <ul>
  <li>the <tt>empty</tt> list or <tt>'()</tt> for short;</li>
  <li><tt>(cons Symbol S-expression)</tt></li>
  <li><tt>(cons S-expression S-expression)</tt></li>
 </ul>
 For this problem, we ignore what this data represents. In general, though,
 S-expressions are useful to represent the abstract syntax of any form of
 program (Java, Scheme, XML, etc). 
 </p>

<p> Design the following functions: 
 <ol>
  <li><tt>count</tt>, which counts the number of symbols in an S-expression;</li>
  <li><tt>flatten</tt>, which produces the list of all symbols in an
    S-expression (duplicates allowed)</li> 
  <li><tt>substitute</tt>, which replaces some <tt>old</tt> symbol with a
    <tt>new</tt> symbol in the given S-expression.</li>
 </ol>
</p>
</blockquote>


<p><b>Problem 3</b>:</p>

<blockquote>
 Design the function <tt>silly</tt>. The function consumes a Mobile (see
 Problem 1). It produces a Mobile, by adding to each sculpture <tt>S</tt>
 (remember that it is represented by its weight) the depth of <tt>S</tt> in
 the Mobile. 
</blockquote>


<p><b>Problem 4</b>:</p>

<blockquote>
 Design the function <tt>free</tt>. It consumes an S-expression of the
 following shape. 
 <blockquote>
  An <em>XY</em> is one of: 
  <ul>
    <li>a <tt>Symbol</tt></li>
    <li><tt>(list 'function Symbol XY)</tt></li>
    <li><tt>(list XY XY)</tt></li>
  </ul>
 </blockquote>
 It produces an S-expression of this shape: 
 <blockquote>
  An <em>AB</em> is one of: 
  <ul>
    <li>a <tt>Number</tt></li>
    <li>a <tt>Symbol</tt></li>
    <li><tt>(list 'function Symbol AB)</tt></li>
    <li><tt>(list AB AB)</tt></li>
  </ul>
 </blockquote>
 For each symbol introduced by the first clause in an <tt>XY</tt>
 S-expression, <tt>free</tt> replaces it with the number of
 <tt>'function</tt> symbols between it and the closest 
 <tt>'function</tt> node that lists the same symbol. If there is no such
 node, the symbol is transferred to the output. 

 <p>For example, when given 
<pre>
       '(function y
	  ((function x 
	     (x y))
	    (x y)))
</pre>
  <tt>free</tt> produces 
<pre>
      '(function y
	  ((function x 
	     (0 1))
	    (x 0)))
</pre>
 </p>
</blockquote>


<p><b>Problem 5</b>:</p>

<blockquote>Here is a rigorous definition of the set of shapes from the
  first quiz. A <em>Shape</em> is one of:
 <ul>
   <li>
    a rectangle whose sides are parallel to the two axes, specified as the
    collection of four numbers:  <tt>xmin</tt>, <tt>xmax</tt>, <tt>ymin</tt>, and
    <tt>ymax</tt> subject to the constraint that <tt>xmin</tt> &lt; <tt>xmax</tt>
    and <tt>ymin</tt> &lt; <tt>ymax</tt>.
   </li>

   <li>
    a combination of two shapes.
   </li>
  </ul>
 Nothing else is a shape.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>Prove that
 <ol>
  <li>
    all elements of <tt>Shape</tt> contain an even number of numbers;
  </li> 
  <li>
    the number of rectangles in a <tt>Shape</tt> is always larger than the
    number of combinations; 
  </li>
  <li>
    the area covered by all rectangles in a <tt>Shape</tt> is smaller than
    the "general" area of a shape. The "general" area of a shape <tt>S</tt> is 
<center>
(max { xmax | xmax in all rectangles in <tt>S</tt>} - min { xmin | xmin in all rectangles in <tt>S</tt>})<br />
*<br />
(max { ymax | ymax in all rectangles in <tt>S</tt>} - min { ymin | ymin in all rectangles in <tt>S</tt>})
</center>
  </li>
 </ol>
