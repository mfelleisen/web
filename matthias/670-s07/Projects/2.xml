<h3>Double or Nothing</h3>

<p>
 <b>Objective:</b> to get a first taste of <em>pair collaborations</em> and
 the <em>svn server</em>
</p>

<p>
 <b>Mechanism:</b> re-do homework 1 using the svn server. Create a
 directory titled "Project2" with the following structure: 
<pre>
<code>
  Project2
   |
   +---------------- Memos 
   |                  |
   |                  +------> task1.html
   |                  +------> task2.html
   |                  +------> task2a.html
   |
   |
   |
   +---------------- Script
                      |
                      +------> README.txt (how to run, docs)
                      +------> code.EXTENSION 
</code>
</pre>
 You may assume that we supplement a copy of the "aircraft" directory for
 testing. 
</p>

<p>
 You may obtain credit only for the first <em>or</em> second homework. 
</p>

<hr />

<p>
 <b>Task 1:</b> Describe in a memo the process of buying gas for a passenger
 car. You may wish to visit a near-by gas station and watch several
 transactions at some pump, especially if you haven't bought gas in a
 while. Limit: one printed page formatted using
 <a href="document.html">HTML in this style.</a> [POINTS: 4]
</p>

<p>
 <b>Task 2:</b> Your second task is to analyze the story from the software
 perspective. Describe the major concepts; then identify and describe the
 use case[s]. Limit: one printed page formatted using
 <a href="document.html">HTML in this style.</a> [POINTS: 4]
</p>

<p>
 <b>Task 2a:</b> Consider the following problems that may occur during a
 "refill" trip: (1) rejection of credit card; (2) the driver decides to
 drive away <em>after</em> getting his credit card authorized and
 <em>before</em> lifting the handle; or (3) the driver fills his tank and
 then forgets to press YES or NO for the usual "do you want a receipt
 question." [POINTS: 4] Can you think of an additional problem situation?
 [POINTS: 2]
</p>

<p>
 <b>Task 3:</b> Download the tar bundle from the "Aircrafts" page (see tab on the
 left). Design a program/script that changes the <code>index.xml</code>
 file as follows: (1) it changes the nation attribute to "allies" or "axis"
 as appropriate; (2) for an aircraft without image attribute, it creates an
 image attribute of the shape `<code>image =
 "question.jpg"</code>'. [POINTS: 6]
