  <p>You will work on approximately one project per week. These projects
  will include writing assignments, modifications of Java programs,
  designing and implementing a project from scratch, and maintaining or
  modifying code. Like in the real world, the project descriptions will
  become available only a short time (typically a week or so) before they
  are due. This simulates the time pressure you will experience in
  industry. As you rush to complete your projects, don't forget, however,
  that performing tasks systematically and looking ahead often makes life
  easy in the long run.
  </p>

  <p>The main project of the course is to implement a card game, dubbed
  <em>Squadron Scramble</em>. For your orientation, a description of the
  game is available through the tabs on the left. Don't start implementing
  just yet, because you don't know what you are to implement.</p>

<scheme>(generalp "Pair Programming")</scheme>

<p>You must work on all projects in pairs. Pair programming means that you
  do all things together.
</p>

<p>Start searching for a partner now. You must submit your partner's name
  to Richard C. by <font color="red">on Friday, 12 January 2007</font>.  In
  return, you will get account on the Subversion server, which will be your
  only means to submit projects after the first week. 
</p>

<scheme>(generalp "Submission")</scheme>

<p>
  All of your work will live on the Subversion server, organized according
  to Richard C's instructions. On the specified due date and time, an
  automatic script will copy the homework project into our space. 
</p>

<p>
  Richard will present the Subversion server and instructions on how to
  organize your account on <font color="red">Tuesday, 16 January
  2007</font> in class. You must attend this lecture if you wish to get a
  grade in this course.
</p>

<p>
  For every project you will also turn in a cover page in the first class
  following the due date. The cover page contains these pieces: the project
  title, the date, the names of the partners, the signatures of the two
  partners, the list of points you chose not to pursue.  The signatures
  guarantee that you completed the task without any outside assistance. If
  we discover plagiarism in any form after that, we will deal with the
  issue as if we were a company that is being sued because one of its
  programmers used source code from outside the company without explicit
  permission of the owner.
