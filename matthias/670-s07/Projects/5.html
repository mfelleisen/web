<h3>Representing Players and Turns</h3>

<p>
 It is now time to look at the big picture again. The eventual goal is to
 have a Squadron Scramble game system that can pitch a number of different
 automatic players against each other. You may even consider including a
 human player later. 
</p>

<p>
 The last project created the basic ingredients for an automatic player:
 representations of cards, decks, stacks, hands, and squadrons. Based on
 these you can now implement an automatic player and test it rigorously
 before you link it into a game administrator (possibly your own). 
</p>

<font color="darkpurple">
<p><b>New Task 0:</b> [POINTS: 5, by Friday NOON only] Draw a sequence
  diagram for the implicitly proposed interaction between the game
  administrator and players of Squadron Scramble.
</p>
</font>

<p><b>Task 1:</b> [POINTS: 20] Implement a Squadron Scramble
 <code>turn</code>. The purpose of a <code>turn</code> object is to
 represent the (sub)state of the game that the player needs to know to play
 the game, assuming the player encapsulates its own state. In our case,
 this means the deck, the discard stack, the discarded bomber squadrons of
 the other players. For completeness sake, my <code>turn</code>
 representation also includes the name of the player whose turn it
 is. (This alludes to the idea that the administrator could also keep track
 of the player's state and hand it back for a turn.)</p>

<p>
 In addition, a <code>turn</code> must also include methods that allow the
 player to perform all legal game actions. As discussed in class, a
 software designer must make a trade-off here, either equipping the turn
 with imperative actions that record the actions or demanding a record of
 the actions as a part of the player's <code>take-turn</code> return
 values. The signature of <code>turn</code> shows that I have come up with
 a compromise solution: the actions of taking cards from the deck or stack
 are imperative capabilities of the <code>turn</code> object while attacks
 and discarded squadrons are recorded in the result of the
 <code>player</code>'s <code>take-turn</code> method.

<p><b>Task 2:</b> [POINTS: 20] Implement a Squadron Scramble
 <code>player</code>. In principle, such a player can pursue many
 different strategies and can even switch strategies during a game. For
 this assignment, your program must play the game as follows: 
</p>
<ol>
<li>
 unless the deck is empty, it takes one card from the desk or a random
 number of cards from the stack;
</li>

<li>
 it forms as many complete fighter squadrons (using wild cards where
 needed) to attack as many bomber squadrons as possible;
</li>

<li> 
 it discard as many complete remaining squadrons as possible; and 
</li>

<li>
 it returns a card.
</li>
</ol>
