<font color="red" style="italic">Presenter</font>

<p>For a presentation of your designs or a code walk, please proceed as
follows:
<ol>

 <li>Concisely restate the task, which points you chose to pursue, and
 which ones you chose to ignore.</li>

 <li>Provide an overview of your solution. For code walks, this should include
 two parts:  
   <ol>

   <li>a (UML class) diagram of the major components and their
    relationships;</li>

   <li>a (UML interaction) diagram that explains the major interactions
    during a program execution.</li>
   </ol>

 In addition, you may have to explain other aspects of the design with
 diagrams, pictures, etc. 
</li>

 <li>Present the components and their functionality in a top-down fashion,
 no matter how you designed and implemented them. Refine as requested. Be
 prepared to defend your code organization, why it matches or doesn't match
 your design. </li>
</ol>
 In general, be prepared to figure out in real time how changes to your
 information/data specification are translated into changes in your program
 organization. 
</p>

<p>When we evaluate the quality of a code walk, we are looking at three
 different aspects: 
<ol>
 <li>the presentation order (see above)</li>
 <li>your ability to focus from the context to specific lines of code</li>
 <li>your ability to think through issues that the panel, the class, or the
 course staff brings up. If you haven't written the code or if you haven't
 written the code as a pair, you will have serious problems with this
 part.</li>
</ol>
 At this point, I don't know how to teach you these skills other than
 having you present several code walks and watch a lot of them. 
</p>


<div><hr /><font color="red">Listener</font></div>

<p>As a listener, you will play three different roles: 

<ul>
<li>a manager, who is the first "reader" (analyst) and who has the
  responsibility that the presentation stays on track;</li>

<li>an assistant reader, who is the second "code reader";</li>

<li>secretary, who keeps track of the questions that the readers ask, notes
  discoveries of weak spots, and takes notes as needed.</li>
</ul>
When you are "secretary" you are responsible to get a copy of the written
notes to Richard C. within 8 hours. If the report is acceptable, we will
forward it to the reviewed pair; if not, we will request edits. 
</p>

<p>When we evaluate the quality of a panel, we are focusing on the two
  readers:
<ol>
 <li>OK+ means the reader discovers solid problems and articulates them
 well. This appears to depend on the quality of the code basis. Because all
 code bases are somewhat flawed, however, the quality of the presented code
 doesn't really affect your ability to get this grade. 
 </li>

 <li>OK means the reader asks pertinent questions and discovers some problems.</li>

 <li>OK- means the reader asks questions and some of them are pertinent.</li>

 <li>ZERO means the reader didn't ask any questions or asked too few
 questions pertinent to the code/design at hand.</li>
</ol>
 At this point, I don't know how to teach you these skills other than
 having you watch a lot of code walks. A secretary who asks pertinent
 questions receives bonus points.
</p>

<hr />

<p>The HTML memo from the secretary to the presenters must include the following
  information: 
<ol>
 <li>the presenters</li>
 <li>the panelists</li>
 <li>the title of the project presented</li>
 <li>the date and time</li>
 <li>a bullet list of problems discovered. Describes those problems in
 enough details so that the presenters can reconstruct it and fix it from
 the information specified. 
 </li>
 <li>If the panel discussed potential solutions with the presenters,
 include these suggestions with the appropriate bullet. 
 </li>
</ol>
 Recall that panels do not usually discuss solutions, however, with the
 presenters. 
</p>

<p>
 The evaluation of a memo will take into account the timely delivery of the
 first draft, its format, its information content, and basic English
 writing (typos, grammar mistakes). The latter will affect your grade in a
 serious manner if the mistake allows a misinterpretation of a sentence or
 if the mistake makes an interpretation extremely difficult.
