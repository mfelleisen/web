<h3>On Trusting Players</h3>

<p>
 After watching the code walks yesterday and after receiving several
 inquiries on "trusting players", I have decided to provide some 
 additional design suggestions. 
</p>

<p>
 When a Project specification requests that you check the player's
 actions for attempted cheating, you definitely may <em>not</em> assume
 that players are trustworthy. You can't trust the player's hand; its
 designer may have added code to add cards in between turns. You can't
 trust the player's scoring of course; why not add a few points here and
 there while the "dealer" isn't looking. So no, don't trust the player for
 anything. Just imagine an open competition where friends and classmates
 program to the same interface and plug in players with the only goal of
 winning the Squadron Scramble tournament at all costs. 
</p>

<p>
 When a Project specification requests that you develop an automated
 Squadron Scramble player with a decent strategy, then imagine yourself
 playing the game -- with the information that you get through the 
 specified interface. Is it useful to keep track of your score? Is it
 useful to keep track of your discards? Your attacks? The discards of the
 rest of the players? In other words, does it help your planning efforts if
 you know that almost all cards have been discarded, i.e., you're nearing
 the end of a battle? Well, if it is, your automated player should keep
 track of these items.
