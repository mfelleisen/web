      Several folks have complained that I took off points on project 5
      because their compile script didn't work, even though it worked for
      them on one of the Solaris machines in the lab.  The problems usually
      involve bad <code>PATH</code> settings, although they've also
      included extraneous carriage returns in the scripts or missing
      directories in the repository.  I've even had one instance where the
      project directory contained only the README and the three compile
      scripts, even though TortoiseSVN claimed that everything was
      committed to the turnin directory.

    <p>
      It is <em>your</em> responsibility to make sure that your projects
      compile on Solaris.  I have specified <em>exactly</em> what you may
      and may not assume about the environment in which I run the scripts,
      in the blog posts dated Jan 31 and Feb 13.  I have neither the time
      nor the inclination to debug everyone's compile scripts as I grade.
    </p>

    <p>
      Given that you lose points if this doesn't work, it would be in your
      best interest to check out a <em>fresh</em> copy of your submission
      directory on Solaris and attempt to build the project from scratch.
      In case you have any doubts about what this means: remove
      <em>all</em> files from your local working directory and check out
      the relevant parts from SVN.

<p> <font color="red"> I really shouldn't have to say this, considering how
      much we've emphasized testing in this course.  The testing the
      delivery and installation mechanisms is as important as testing the
      software itself.
