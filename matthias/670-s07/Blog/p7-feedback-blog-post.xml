As part of grading, I ran everyone's harness against a very simple test

provided as specified in the blog post from yesterday.

In this stage, I was only checking whether your harness completed the test
case, not whether it produced the expected results.  So, if your feedback
report indicates that your harness ran successfully against this input,
this means only that it did not crash, and that it produced output that
looks vaguely syntactically valid given the project's specification.  This
statement does <em>not</em> guarantee that your system performed correctly
against the test case.

Also, many teams lost a point for not documenting that the fourth argument
to <code>playOneTurn</code> means: is it all of the discarded squadrons, or
only the bombers?  This was indeed up to you for this project, so you could
choose either.  Of course, your Administrator's client needs to know, so
your choice needs to be documented in the Administrator interface.
Further, your use of this argument must be consistent with its description:
since <code>Turn</code>'s constructor expects a list of the other players'
discarded bombers as its 4th argument, then if you define
<code>playOneTurn</code> to accept a list of <em>all</em> discarded
squadrons, then you have to filter it accordingly before creating the
turn.
