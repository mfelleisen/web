Here are Richard's directions for turning in Project 12: 
<p>
Create a Memos/Project12 directory, as specified in the blog post from Jan
23.  For task 1, create a Task1 directory within Memos/Project12.  Put all
of your design documents here, in portable document formats: HTML, PS, PDF,
JPG, GIF, PNG, TXT.
</p>

<p>
Your Task1 directory should also contain a file named Task1.html, which
provides an overview of your design changes -- the kind of thing you might
start with, should you happen to give a code walk for your project.  This
document should also explain what the rest of the files in the Task1
directory represent.  See the blog post from 2/13 for formatting guidelines
for this memo.
</p>

<p>
For task 3, simply submit a memo according to the standard directions (see
blog posts from 1/23 and 2/13).
