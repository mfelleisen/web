 Richard will grade the remaining projects (12 and 13) this week; I have
 graded a select subset of your final code-walk memos. Friday morning,
 after I return from a quick trip, we will determine the final grades for
 this course.
</p>

<p>
 I have enjoyed the semester a lot, and I hope you have, too. Some of the
 lessons may have sunk in now, and some will only reveal themselves in the
 future when you're out there, working on real projects. (I know you had
 little time to read the suggested reading. Take notes and find the
 chapters and papers when you'll need them.) 
</p>

<p>Keep us in mind; keep us posted; and good luck to you all.</p>
