Subject: test fest administrator ready

Matthias:

I've put (a version of) the test-fest administrator into everyone's SVN
directory.  Unfortunately, it's not the same one that we ran, so the
students may see different error messages -- I'm pretty sure I made this
tarball up before you added the various contracts to the codebase.

Blog post for students included below.

=============================================================================

Since several teams have asked about why their test cases failed, we have
made our test fest administrator available to you to run.  While you can't
inspect the administrator (it's in compiled form), you can still instrument
your own code to get additional information about exactly what's happening.

The test fest administrator is now in SVN, in your submission directories
for projects 6 and 7.  Within those directories, I've added several things:

    run-admin-6
    run-admin-7
    compiled/
    utils/
    aircrafts/    (if you didn't already have this directory)

The administrator will only work on the CCIS Solaris network.  To run it:

  1) If you still have copies of these turnin directories checked out, then
     update them.  Otherwise,

        svn co http://svn.barzilay.org/670/<<TEAM>>/turnin/Project6
        svn co http://svn.barzilay.org/670/<<TEAM>>/turnin/Project7

     making the obvious replacement for <<TEAM>>.

  2) cd to Project6 or Project7, as appropriate.

  3) Invoke the run-admin-6 or run-admin-7 script.  Each script expects two
     command line arguments: the script that starts your test harness
     (run-harness, if you followed our submission directions), and the
     directory containing the test cases (Tests/Project6 or tests/Project7,
     if you followed our directions).
