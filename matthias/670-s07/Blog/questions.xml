<p>
In response to those questions that revealed problems with the
<a href="Projects/squadron.html">rules of Squadron Scramble</a>, I have
altered the description in two ways. When a question deserved mention, the
revised description contains an explicit Q/A part (questions are in blue,
answers in purple). When a question could be answered with a small change
to the wording of a paragraph, I did that (in purple). 
</p>

<p>
Please study the game again. On Tuesday, I will conduct a five-minute
Q-and-A session for last-minute questions on the rules. After that, you
will have to "pay" to get answers. Specifically, for every question that we
answer, you will sacrifice two homework points from the specific homework.
