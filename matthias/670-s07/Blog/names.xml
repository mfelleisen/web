One task of Project 3 is to represent the basic data of Sqaudron Scramble and
some basic functions on it, e.g., <code>cards-have-same-name</code>. These
functions perform the tasks that their names suggest. For
<code>card-&lt;</code> you are to implement a comparison that would help you
order the cards on your hand (insert a new one at the proper place), just like
in real life.
