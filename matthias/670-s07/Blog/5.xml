<b>Turning in Project 5/Task 0:</b> Please create a Project5a directory
under turnin (in SVN), with the diagram in Memos/Project5 as normal. Add
text files there, if needed. Use ASCII or PDF for the diagram. Richard has
no obligation to grade any other format. So, if you plan on using a drawing
tool, including a UML tool (no need to do so!), make sure it can export
PDF.
