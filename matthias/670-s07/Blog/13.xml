<p>
 The deadline for Project 13 was extended by two hours. 
</p>

<p>
 I have also made cosmetic changes to Project 13, and I have spelled out a
 hint concerning the client side. (See red text) -- 
 Use case 1 was changed only as a hint. You're welcome to implement it in
 any way you know how to fire up a TCP recipient. 
</p>

<p>
 When you turn in Project 13, be sure to include scripts that compile/run the
 server and client programs independently.

<p>
 For test fest "Project 10", my transmission routines inserted comments
 into non-empty elements with the intention of finally breaking programs
 based on regular-expression. The following is a legitimate
 <code>END</code> message: 
<pre><code><font size="-2">
&lt;END>&lt;AIRCRAFT NAME="Bell P-39D" TAG="2" />&lt;LIST />&lt;/END>
</font></code></pre>
 Adding a comment to this message is legitimate according to the rules: 
<pre><code><font size="-2">
&lt;END>&lt;!--are you reg-exp-ing for &lt;/END>-->&lt;AIRCRAFT NAME="Bell P-39D" TAG="2" />&lt;LIST />&lt;/END>
</font></code></pre>
 The embedded <code>&lt;END></code> text causes problems if you base the
 legitimacy test of tree-structured data on regular-expression matching. --
 I mentioned this fact time and again during code walks and also reminded
 you that this fact is the subject of the first and key part of CS U 390, 
 the only true prerequisite of the course.
