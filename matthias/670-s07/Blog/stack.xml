<div time="1169914559">

<p>
 Ventz Petkov pointed out a mistake in the signature of <code>pop</code> for
 <a href="Projects/4.html#stack">Stacks in Project 4</a>, which I have fixed
 now. (This just shows again the dangers of manually porting code to html.)
</p>

<p>
 I have also noticed a missing requirement in <code>Squadron</code>, so
 please take a second look.
