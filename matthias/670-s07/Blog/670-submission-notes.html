    <h1>CSU 670 Spring 2007: Project Requirements</h1>

    <h2>Richard Cobbe</h2>

    <p>
      There's been a lot of confusion, apparently, about the precise
      requirements for project layout, memo formatting, scripts, and so
      forth.  This document attempts to clarify this.  As of project 6, I
      will start taking off large numbers of points if you do not follow
      these guidelines.
    </p>

    <h2>Directory Layout</h2>

    <p>
      Within your submission directory, I must see the following files and
      directories, in the following locations.  (This isn't a change; I'm
      just being very specific about our expectations.)
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <code>README</code> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This must be a text
          file, limited to 80 columns per line, that contains a roadmap
          for your code.
        </p>

        <p>
          The roadmap is simply a <em>short</em> (one-line) description
          of each file and directory within your project.  You may omit
          the <code>Memos</code> directory and the scripts described
          below.  Furthermore, if you have added third-party libraries to
          your project, your roadmap should identify and describe only
          the top-level directory for the library; you do not need to
          describe each library file.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          <code>compile</code> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This must be an
          executable file that compiles your project and your test cases.
          (If you're using a scripting language like Perl or Ruby,
          then <code>compile</code> should simply print a message that
          says that no compilation is necessary.)  See below for additional
          requirements that apply to this script.
        </p>

      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          <code>run</code> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This must be an executable
          file that runs your program.  If there is no program to run, as
          with the earlier assignments, then this should be a NOP.  See
          below for additional requirements that apply to this script.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          <code>run-tests</code> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This must be an
          executable file that runs your program's test cases.  On the rare
          occasion when there are no test cases, then this should be a NOP.
          See below for additional requirements that apply to this script.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          <code>Memos/</code> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This directory will
          contain all of your memos, sorted by project:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p><code>Project6/</code> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This directory
              contains memos for project 6.  See below for formatting
              requirements.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p><code>Project7/</code> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; memos for
              project 7.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>... and so on.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Otherwise, you may arrange your files and directories however you
      like.
    </p>

    <p>
       <strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> you should generally avoid filenames that
      contain spaces, as the Unix shell scripting languages don't deal with
      these very well.  (Yes, thanks, I know the tricks to work around
      those problems, and I'm not interested.  Just don't do it.)  You must
      absolutely avoid spaces in the filenames of files that we
      specifically ask for by name.  If you put spaces in other filenames
      in your project, it is <em>your</em> responsibility to ensure that
      your <code>compile</code> etc. scripts work correctly on Solaris.
    </p>

    <h2>Script Requirements</h2>

    <p>
      This section describes requirements that apply to
      the <code>compile</code>, <code>run</code>,
      and <code>run-tests</code> scripts.
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          These scripts must be executable: when I check them out, they
          should automatically have Unix permissions at
          least <code>-rwxr-xr-x</code>.  To ensure this, especially if
          you're using a different OS for your development, execute the
          following command:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          <pre>svn propset svn:executable x compile run run-tests</pre>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          and commit the change.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          Furthermore, if this file is a script (and it probably is),
          then please make sure that it does not contain any Windows
          end-of-line markings.  If you're developing on Windows, please
          execute the following command to have SVN automatically
          translate Windows end-of-line markers to Unix:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          <pre>svn propset svn:eol-style native compile ...</pre>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          and commit the change.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          You may make only limited assumptions about the environment in
          which we will run your programs, including
          the <code>compile</code>, <code>run</code>,
          and <code>run-tests</code> scripts.  You may assume only the
          following
          variable:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>
            <code>
              PATH=/arch/unix/bin:/usr/X11R6/bin:/usr/bin:/bin
            </code>
          </p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          You may also assume an appropriate setting
          for <code>TERM</code>.
        </p>

        <p>
          This has three consequences.  First, if you need some other
          setting in your environment (which is unlikely given the nature
          of the project and the languages most of you are using), you
          must set those environment variables directly within your
          scripts.
        </p>

        <p>
          Second, if you use a compiler or runtime that's not in the
          above PATH, you must adjust your scripts accordingly.  You may
          either set the <code>PATH</code> variable in those scripts, or
          you may specify absolute paths for compilers, etc.  (In
          particular, if you need Java 5, you must arrange for the
          scripts to use <code>javac</code> and <code>java</code> out
          of <code>/arch/beta/bin</code>, not out
          of <code>/usr/bin</code>.  And if you're using Ant with Java5,
          you <strong>must</strong> set the <code>PATH</code> variable
          within your script, or Ant won't be able to find the correct
          compiler.)
        </p>

        <p>
          Third: no <code>DISPLAY</code> variable, so no GUIs.  If we
          ask you to write a GUI at some point, we'll explicitly relax
          this restriction.
        </p>

        <p>
          To ensure that your script runs in these environments, run your
          scripts as follows:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          <pre>/usr/bin/env -i PATH=/arch/unix/bin:/usr/X11R6/bin:/usr/bin:/bin TERM=$TERM ./compile
          </pre>
        </blockquote>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          You should assume that I will run your script from the directory
          which contains it (that is, from
          within <code>turnin/Project<i>N</i></code>).  Of course, since
          this will be in <em>my</em> working copy, you shouldn't make any
          assumptions about what that directory is named.  So, if your
          program or scripts have to refer to files in your submission by
          name, you should specify these with paths relative to your
          submission's top-level directory.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Memo Formatting Requirements</h2>

    <p>
      Memos must be written in HTML.  Further:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          The memo's file name must indicate the task: the memo for task
          3 must be in <code>task3.html</code>, and so on.  In filenames,
          spelling, punctuation, and capitalization are significant.
          Also, you may not put spaces in your filenames.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          The memo must begin with a first-level header (i.e.,
          &lt;h1&gt;) that states your name and your partner's name.  The
          next thing in the memo most be a second-level header (i.e.,
          &lt;h2&gt;) that identifies the project and the task (simply
          saying "Project 7, Task 2" is sufficient).
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          Code snippets may be in monospaced text, but the main text must
          be in the default (proportionally-spaced) font.  If you have to
          use the horizontal scroll bar to see all of the text on a
          reasonably-sized browser window, you have a problem.  (Here's
          why: when I convert these to PS and then to PDF for printing,
          the tool I use scales the document down so that it's one page
          wide.  If the text is wide enough to require the horizontal
          scroll bar, the text in the PS file is too small to read.)
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          Don't include figures or images.  If a memo specifically
          requires them, we'll give you specific instructions on what to
          do.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          I shouldn't have to say this, but just to be clear on
          expectations: no JavaScript, ECMAScript, Java applets, etc.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          I <em>really</em> shouldn't have to say this: normal English
          rules of spelling, punctuation, grammar, and so forth still
          apply.  You will lose points if you have too many mistakes at
          this level.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
