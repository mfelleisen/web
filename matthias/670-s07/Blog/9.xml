As of Project 9 your XML facilities must deal with two common elements: 
<ol>
<li>
  COMMENTS. The test cases from Projects 6 and 7 have shown that people
  need comments in their test cases so that they can create a pattern with
  comments and fill in the gaps for the specific cases. 
</li>

<li>
 ABBREVIATIONS. Your XML readers and parsers must tolerate both forms of
 elements without sub-elements, i.e., both &lt;LIST&gt; &lt;/LIST&gt; as
 well as &lt;LIST /&gt; must work for the XML representation of the empty
 list. 
</li>
</ol>
