People have asked how the run-script should work for Project 11. There are
two parts to the answer: 

<ol>
<li>
 Do *not*, by default, display the player UIs from project 8.
 We will <em>penalize</em> people for opening windows. 
</li>

<li>
After each <em>game</em>, print out a brief report that contains the
(cumulative) score for each player and also indicates whether players were
removed for cheating, contract violations, or other problems.  All reports
should be written to stdout and look something like this for a successful
game:
<pre><code>  the war took 2 battles

  Matthew : 465
  Robby : 300
  Shriram : 10</code></pre>
and more like that when bad things happen: 
<pre><code>  the war took 2 battles

  Robby: CHEATED
  Matthias: BROKE CONTRACT
  Shriram : 0</code></pre>
Your run-script should use between three and six players to run two or
three games.  

<p>
 Optionally, you may also print such reports after each <em>battle.</em>
