Someone asked: 

<blockquote>
<p>Does this mean that we should have all static methods?  In the OO
course, we learned how to convert non-object-oriented signatures into
object-oriented methods by using the implicit 'this' for the first argument
in cases where the that argument was the object that the method belonged
to.</p>

<p>Is this correct?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you are NOT using an OO PL, you should implement the signature AS IS. </p>

<p>If you are using an OO PL, you should implement the signature IN THE
  SPIRIT OF 213 (or 370). In other words, you didn't just learn this in
  370 (OO), you grew up with this from the very first day at NU.</p>

<p>
The signatures are specified in a true-and-only OO manner. They specify
that the first argument is THIS or SELF and the remaining arguments are the
arguments of a method. I don't want to force people, however, to use an OO
language, which is why I allow for this much variance. Otherwise you are to
implement the signature as-is, especially the state-less part.
