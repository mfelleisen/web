<p>
 For your final code walk (Tues and Wedn), you will need to run your game
 administrator so that it can hook up with my players, and three of your
 players to work with my game administrator. You will find out what the IP
 number for my game administrator is right before the code walk, and you
 will determine your IP number so that I can fire up my players to look for
 your port. Show up 5-10 minutes early so that you have plenty of time to
 get things to run.
