Richard has written up two suggestions that are "must reads": 
<ol>
 <li><a href="Blog/svn-error.html">how to deal with a common and obscure SVN error message;</a></li>
 <li><a href="Blog/blog-post-02-21.html">how to deal with the "runnable scripts" grading policy.</a></li>
</ol>
Both are important for both your grade and your learning/preparation for
the workplace.
