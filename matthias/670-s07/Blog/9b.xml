Someone asked: 
<blockquote>
 Suppose the harness receives an ill-formed turn. In that case, it will
 send a CONTRACT message and close its input port <em>before</em> the
 administrator can send the GET-CARDs requests. Is this acceptable? 
</blockquote>
The answer is that this is <em>not</em> in the spirit of the assignment
which says that "[t]he goal of these contracts is to prevent ill-behaved
players from crashing the server or from upsetting its basic internal
invariants." In this case, a bad test case designer would crash the test
harness, and that's not what you wish to test. Instead you want to guard
against this. 

<p>
 If you submit such a test case with an ill-formed test, my administrator
 will discover this flaw and throw it out.
