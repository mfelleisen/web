 Richard asked me to post <a href="Blog/zz-notes.html">some guidelines about
 submitting code. </a>
</p>

<p>Here are answers to questions that we are receiving repeatedly: </p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Does the completes function take into account wildcards when determining complete squadrons?</li>

<li>... but a squadron must be at least 2 aircraft cards and at most 1 wildcard
  from the game rules.  Which spec should we follow?</li>

<li>For the deck constructor, by directory order of cards, do you mean that
  we actually import from the xml file and then just use the order of cards
  as they are in the index.xml file?</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
The answer is that a squadron is a collection of three cards: at least one
is an airplane and one or two others are wildcards. Yes, the specs
contradict the original rules, i.e., your customer has changed his
(absent-mineded) mind. Oh, and all aircraft cards in a
squadron must have the same name.  

<p>Someone else also asked: 
<blockquote>For the deck constructor, by directory order of cards, do you
  mean that we actually import from the xml file and then just use the
  order of cards as they are in the index.xml file?
</blockquote>
And yes, you are to use the directory with an XML index file and images to
create the collection of <em>all</em> cards. You may consider this your
first deck, but recall that you also must provide a function for shuffling
the deck.
