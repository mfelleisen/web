      Several notes about homework submissions:

      <ul>
        <li><p>Do not put spaces in your filenames.</p></li>

        <li><p>Write memos in the HTML format specified in project 2.</p></li>

        <li><p>Limit your README to 80 columns a line, please.</p></li>

          <p>
            You may make only limited assumptions about the environment in
            which we will run your programs, including
            the <code>compile</code>, <code>run</code>,
            and <code>run-tests</code> scripts.  You may assume only the
            following
            variable:

            <blockquote>
              <code>PATH=/arch/unix/bin:/usr/X11R6/bin:/usr/bin:/bin</code>
            </blockquote>
            You may also assume an appropriate setting
            for <code>TERM</code>.
          </p>

          <p>
            This has three consequences.  First, if you need some other
            setting in your environment (which is unlikely given the nature
            of the project and the languages most of you are using), you
            must set those environment variables directly within your
            scripts.
          </p>

          <p>
            Second, if you use a compiler or runtime that's not in the
            above PATH, you must adjust your scripts accordingly.  You may
            either set the <code>PATH</code> variable in those scripts, or
            you may specify absolute paths for compilers, etc.  (In
            particular, if you need Java 5, you must arrange for the
            scripts to use <code>javac</code> and <code>java</code> out
            of <code>/arch/beta/bin</code>, not out
            of <code>/usr/bin</code>.)
          </p>

          <p>
            Third: no <code>DISPLAY</code> variable, so no GUIs.  If we
            ask you to write a GUI at some point, we'll explicitly relax
            this restriction.
          </p>

          <p>
            To test your setup, run your scripts as follows:

            <blockquote>
              <pre>/usr/bin/env -i PATH=/arch/unix/bin:/usr/X11R6/bin:/usr/bin:/bin TERM=$TERM ./compile
              </pre>
            </blockquote>
          </p>

        <li>
          <p>
            Along the lines of the following item, you may assume that we
            will run your scripts from within the top-level directory of
            your submission (that is, from
            within <code>turnin/ProjectN</code>, the directory that is
            supposed to contain the scripts).  Of course, you shouldn't
            make any assumptions about what that directory
            is <em>named</em>, as we'll almost certainly check it out with
            a different name when we grade.  (Grading twenty-five different
            directories all named <code>Project3</code> doesn't work so
            well.)
          </p>

          <p>
            On a related note: do not use absolute paths to refer to parts
            of your submission.
          </p>

            As some of you have learned, the different end-of-line
            conventions can cause problems with cross-platform portability.
            Fortunately, Subversion can help with this.  For plain text
            files, including and <em>especially</em>
            the <code>compile</code>, <code>run</code>,
            and <code>run-tests</code> scripts, you need to set
            the <code>svn:eol-style</code> property correctly.  We haven't
            talked about properties, but here's how you do this:
            <blockquote>
              <pre>svn propset svn:eol-style native README</pre>
            </blockquote>
            where <code>README</code> is the name of the file to be set.  As
            with other SVN commands, you may supply multiple file arguments.
            Like any other change, this has to be committed.  See the SVN
            book
            (<a
                href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/nightly/en/svn.advanced.props.html#svn.advanced.props.manip"><code>propset</code></a>, <a
                                                                                                                                            href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/nightly/en/svn.advanced.props.file-portability.html#svn.advanced.props.special.eol-style"><code>svn:eol-style</code></a>)
            for more details on what's going on here.
          </p>

          <p>
            There is a way to automate this process so that, for example,
            all <code>*.java</code> files are automatically set to a native
            eol-style.  If you're interested, see Richard.
          </p>

        <li>
          <p>
            If you check in your <code>compile</code> script under
            Windows, it won't automatically be executable when you (or we)
            check it out under Solaris.  To fix this, do the following:

            <blockquote>
              <pre>svn propset svn:executable x compile run run-tests</pre>
            </blockquote>

            and commit the change.  (You can actually use any value in
            place of "<code>x</code>"; the important thing is that the
            property actually have a value.)
