 People have sent us inquiries about all kinds of programming
 languages. You are welcome to choose any programming language that runs on
 the public UNIX computers in the lab. For handing-in products
 ("shipping"), you must also provide a script that Richard can invoke from
 the command line.
</p>

<p>
 If the "command-line" restriction represents a hardship for you, please
 send me a one-page memo (plain text!) and request an exception. Those will
 be granted on a case-by-case basis.
