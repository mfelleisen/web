<p><img src="new.gif" width="70" alt="[new]" /> The
<a href="Blog/tf10/results/index.html">numeric results results for test
fest "Project 10"</a> are now available. Please be suspicious of those test
cases for which my player fails. While I won't pretend that my code is
perfect, you have plenty of other test cases to worry about. </p>

<p>For two teams (bcawley-roner and jdg-khanh), the entries are 0/0/0 and the
test result doesn't exist (404 error for links) due to their programs
crashing our machine. We are investigating.
