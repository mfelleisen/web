Several pairs have emailed me with the following question: 
<blockquote>
 Does <code>play-one-turn</code> know about the first hand that the player
 is handed? Doesn't it need the information to determine whether the player
 is cheating? 
</blockquote>
 As you may have noticed, by this time in the semester, I leave it to you
 to organize your classes and methods. In a sense this is 213/370 material
 and you're capable of designing/implementing it. As you do so, keep in
 mind today's hint, i.e., Tester and Administrator are really one
 conceptual unit. So you can create one huge method, but then it becomes
 difficult to create internal unit tests. Or you can create two methods
 plus one that combines them; in this case, you need to figure out where to
 keep all the state. Choose wisely.
