 <li>the "run-harness" script should execute your test harness from Task 2;
    it should expect no command-line arguments and should perform *NO*
    input/output to stdin/stdout beyond that specified in the task.  (I/O
    to other places is fine.)</li>

 <li>Any test cases you write for Task2a should be in Tests/Project7.  We'll
    continue this convention for later assignments; I won't mention this
    again.</li>

    WARNING: we were fairly lenient the first time around on handing files
    in the wrong location for Project6.  Going forward -- and this includes
    your resubmission for project 6 -- your files *must* be in the
    specified locations, as of the deadline, or you will not receive credit
    for the relevant tasks.</p>

    (If you're having SVN problems with submitting, let me know *BEFORE*
    the deadline, and I'll work with you to get those addressed.  But if
    you don't say anything until after the deadline, there's nothing I can
    do.)</p>
