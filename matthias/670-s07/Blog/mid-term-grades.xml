The mid-term grades are now <a href="Blog/mid-term-grades.html">available
on-line.</a>. Read the "Overall" average as a predictor for the final grade
as follows: 
<ul>
<li>"ok+" is between an A+ and a B+;</li>
<li>"ok" is between a B+ and a C;</li>
<li>"ok-" is between a C and a D-; and</li>
<li>"0" is failing.</li>
</ul>
Keep in mind that these are projections based on past performance.
