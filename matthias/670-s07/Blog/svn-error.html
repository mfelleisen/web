      Several people have reported seeing a very strange error message from
      Subversion, usually when they're trying to submit, that looks like the
      following:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <pre>svn: MKCOL of '/670/!svn/wrk/1fbb671d-fe29-0410-8551-f45a352d06c5/lee1tim-leonsico/turnin/Project5':
405 Method Not Allowed (http://svn.barzilay.org)
      </pre>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Since this error message gives you almost no information about what's
      going on, people immediately email me in a panic when they see this.
      Fortunately, it's usually pretty easy to get around this problem.
    </p>
    <p>
      I've seen this error message arise in two cases.  First, you will see
      this error if you try to add a directory to the repository that
      already exists in the repository.  In this case, here's how to
      proceed:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          Move your copy of the directory out of the way.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li><p>
          Use <code>svn revert</code> to back out of the
          uncommitted <code>svn add</code> or <code>svn mkdir</code>.
          Specify the name of the directory as an argument to the
          revert command so you don't delete any other changes by
          mistake.
      </p></li>

      <li><p>
          Use <code>svn update</code> to get the repository's copy of
          the new directory, then merge the contents of your copy in by
          hand.
      </p></li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      Second, you will see this error as you're following
      the <a
             href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/cobbe/670-s07/tools-lecture/node26.html">submission
        instructions</a> but create your <code><i>&lt;TMP&gt;</i></code>
      directory in your existing working copy.  To fix this, just delete
      the temp directory and try again in another location.
    </p>

    <p>
      The next time you see this error message, please try these steps to
      fix the problem before you email me.
    </p>

    <p>
      And, since this is a course about constructing robust software,
      there's something else we can learn from this.  This error is a
      perfect example of why you <strong>must</strong> think about your
      software's error messages, and whether or not they'll be helpful to
      your users&mdash;who almost certainly don't know the software as well
      as you do.
