<p>
As some of you have discovered, entering LARGE test cases is nearly
impossible in Unix terminals. (I was unaware of this limit and hadn't
encountered this problem in previous editions of the course.) So you
must either give up on large test cases or implement the test
administrator(s). 
</p>

<p>
If you are interested in "purchasing" such a test administrator from
Richard, please drop him a line. He will then place a test administrator
(for Solaris) into your SVN directory (where we expected the
administrator). The cost is 5 POINTS.
