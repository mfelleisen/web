<p>I'd imagine that there's a lot involved with bringing a new person into
  this world. No, no -- I don't mean that part, I mean the whole paperwork
  side of things. There's Social Security to set up, a .name domain to
  register, birth certificate, insurance -- especially insurance. With all
  those people feigning pregnancy and labor just to get a stay at the
  hospital and a complimentary "It's a Boy!" balloon, insurers need to be
  extra certain that childbirth claim resulted in a real child.</p> 

<p>As the recent father of twin babies, Philip B. was relieved to learn
  that his employer's benefit provider, Sun Life Canada, made the insurance
  process really simple. Adding the little ones on the plan required no
  more than a phone call to provide birth dates, names, and that sort of
  thing. All seemed so easy, until the customer service rep realized what
  Philip was trying to do: "I'm sorry sir, but we need a different birth
  date for each of your kids."</p> 

<p>"Uhh, er," Philip stuttered, rather puzzled, "they're twins? They were
  both born on the seventh of May, so they actually do have the same birth
  date."</p>

<p>"Oh yes, I understand," she said, "but our system cannot handle two
  people with the same last name born in the same month of the same year on
  the same plan."</p>

<p>Philip's jaw dropped. He inquired some more with the CSR to try
  understand how such a technical limitation could occur. It turns out that
  a new version of their software was installed that tracked each person's
  budget based on their last name, plan number, and month/year of
  birth. Hence, having two people born in the same month and year on one
  plan would cause all claims to be booked against one of the two's budget,
  risking a premature budget exhaustion.</p> 

<p>We can only hope that, by now, Sun Life has corrected their new
  insurance system to account for the unfathomable concept of twins. But as
  of this day, for insurance purposes, Philip's kids are born a month
  apart, one on April 7 and the other on May 7. That, apparently, is much
  more fathomable.</p>
