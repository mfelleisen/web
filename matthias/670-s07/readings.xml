 <p>Felleisen, Findler, Flatt, Krishnamurthi: &nbsp;
 <a href="http://www.htdp.org/"><cite>How to Design Programs</cite></a> &nbsp;
 MIT Press, Cambridge MA 2001

 <blockquote>If you have any doubts what the design recipes are and how to
 match the program organization to the data definition, consult this
 book. This is where you started and, believe it or not, this is what you
 need to remember.</blockquote>

 <p>Beck: &nbsp;
 <cite>Extreme Programming Explained</cite> &nbsp;
 Addison-Wesley, Reading MA 1999

 <blockquote>The philosophies of extreme programming are similar to those
 of the design recipe. The book also includes ideas on pair programming and
 why it is effective. It is a handy reference though it could have been
 written as a 10 page essay.

 <cite>UML Distilled</cite> &nbsp;

     <cite>Elements of Style, 3rd edition.</cite></a>

 <blockquote>You will need to write memos if your investment into your
 education here is to pay off. This little book will help you formulate
 those memos. It is worth purchasing a copy and keeping it on your desk for
 the rest of your career, right next to an English dictionary. Your books
 on programming and software development will change far more often.
