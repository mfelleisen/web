<h2>The Game</h2>

<p>
Carcassonne is a tile-laying game. The objective of the game is to build
and occupy regions within an evolving medieval city-fortress. During the
course of the game, the two to six players gradually construct the map of
the area, using tiles. Certain arrangements of tiles are called regions. In
addition to adding tiles to the map, players also place "followers" on
partially complete regions. When a region is completed during a turn, the
players with the most followers in the region receive points. The game is
over when there are no more tiles available. The player with the most
points wins.</p>

<h3>The Tiles and the Map</h3>

<p>
 Every tile depicts some theme: an abbey, a castle, a road, or a
 combination of these. There is one starter tile.  Take a look at the
 examples (square tiles with pictures). At the beginning of the game the
 designated <a style="text-decoration: none" href="questions.html#player">dealer</a> arranges all the
 tiles face-down to the side and places the starter tile in the middle of
 the table.
</p>

<p>
 At each turn, the dealer retrieves a tile at random from a heap of tiles,
 turns it over, and hands it to the player whose turn it is.  The player
 <a style="text-decoration: none" href="">must add it</a> at some matching place to the map. Matching means that the border
 of each neighboring tile is the same as the border of
 <a style="text-decoration: none" href="questions.html#rotate">the newly placed tile</a>. Also, this
 newly placed tile <em>must</em> share a border with at least one existing
 tile.

<p>Over the course of a game, this map of tiles evolves. The map is usually
 not densely connected; its shape heavily depends on the strategy of the
 players and how they operate to build regions.</p>

<p>
 A region is a part of the map, specifically it is a collection of
 connected tiles with the same theme (roads, castles) or an abbey with its
 surrounding neighbors. A region is complete if it meets the following
 conditions:

<ul>
<li>A road is complete if it has an end piece at either end. End pieces are:
farms; forks in the road; and castles and abbeys.</li>

<li>An abbey is complete if it is surrounded by eight (8) pieces.</li>

<li>A castle is complete if it its walls form a continuous line.</li> 
</ul>
It is permissible to connect two distinct regions with followers, and this
kind of move is indeed an important part of the game.</p>

<h3>Playing a Turn, Playing a Game</h3>

<p>
After placing a piece, a player may also place a follower on a region if
the region is incomplete and if no other follower already occupies the
region. Placing a follower is optional and should follow strategic
considerations because a player has only seven followers.</p>

<p>
When the placement of a tile completes a region, the follower(s) are
immediately returned to their respective player. This implies that the player
who just placed the tile may use a returned follower to end his turn.</p>

<p>A game consists of 70 to 75 turns, depending on the number of players. </p>

<h3>Scoring</h3>

Players receive points when regions are completed. If a region is populated by
the followers of several players, the player with the most followers in the
region receives the points. Sometimes several players have the same number of
followers in the region. In this case all players with the highest number of
followers receive the points. 

<p>Points correspond to the number of pieces in a region. Thus a completed abbey
always yields nine (9) points. A completed road produces as many points as there
are participating tiles, including the end pieces. Each castle tile accounts for
two (2) points, unless it also contains a flag, in which case it accounts for
four (4) points. </p>

<p>At the end of the game, players receive additional points for followers
that occupy abbeys. The score for an incomplete abbey region consists of
one point for the abbey tile plus the number of tiles that touch the
abbey, i.e., a player may obtain up to eight (8) points for an abbey at the
end of the game. The followers on incomplete roads and incomplete castles
are ignored.</p>
