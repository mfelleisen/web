<h2>The After-School Program</h2>

<p>A small local school offers an "extended day program" (EDP), which
  provides after-school care for children. Parents sign up their children
  for this program at the beginning of the school year but the program is
  flexible. The children show up as needed, and parents can pick them up
  any time during the afternoon program.
</p>

<p>At the end of the month, the school office sends out bills to the
  parents of EDP children. The office bills $8 for each half hour of
  EDP that the children attended.
</p>

<p>Currently, the school uses paper and pencil to keep track of the
  children that attend the program. Each day the teacher receives a sheet
  with the names of the registered children, a check-in column, a check-out
  column, and a signature column. When a child shows up, the EDP
  teacher enters the time in the respective row; when the child leaves,
  the teacher enters the time and the parent initials in the signature
  column. At the end of the month, the office tabulates these entries with
  a computer and creates a bill for each family. 
</p>

<p>Recently some generous (?) parent donated an old computer to the
  school. The principal would now like the EDP teacher to keep track of the
  children via this computer to relieve the office of some of the manual
  and labor-intensive data-entry work.
