<scheme>(red-title "Contract")</scheme>

<p>
If you wish to earn a grade in this course, you must perform two tasks
immediately. First you must figure out how to send email to Richard C. with
<ol>
<li>your last name,</li>
<li>first name,</li>
<li>your <em>preferred</em> email address,</li> 
<li>and the last four digits of your NU student number</li>
</ol>
in the body of the email <em>by the end of the first week.</em>
Second, you must print this page, sign it at the top-right, and drop it off
at Richard's desk also by the end of the first week. Your signature
acknowledges that you have read this page, the page on programming
(Projects tab), and the rest of the site, and that you recognize this web
site as contract between you and us.

<scheme>(generalp "Organization")</scheme>

  <p>
    The course is a "studio" course, an idea that originated in art
    schools. In a studio course, the instructor presents basic techniques,
    discusses domain knowledge for specific projects, and then teaches with
    the help of student presentations.</p>

  <p>
    The purpose of student presentations is for everyone to learn to reason
    about problem analysis, designs, and code.  The presenter will learn to
    present products to a team, to defend the product, and to take note of
    weak spots.  Conversely, the listener will learn to analyze and to
    critique a product, helping the presenter uncover flaws. For details on
    how we will conduct the presentations, see the Project page.
  </p>

<scheme>(generalp "Grades")</scheme>

<p>The final grades are based on three factors: your project points (50%),
  your active presentations (20%), your panel participation (20%), your
  journal (5%), and the whim of the instructor (5%).  Each project comes
  with a <em>variable number of points</em>, which in turn are assigned to
  separate parts.  You will <em>not</em> need 100% of the project points to
  obtain a maximal score for the project grade; you can thus learn to pick
  and choose from the list of project parts to maximize on a project's
  success (see <em>Beck</em>). In contrast, you will need all presentation
  and panel points to obtain a full score on these parts; missing a
  presentation as a presenter or listener just won't do. </p>
