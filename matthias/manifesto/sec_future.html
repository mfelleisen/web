 imperfections as opportunities for future research. The remainder of this
 paper sketches some of them.</div></p><p>Racket&rsquo;s key advantage is its syntax extension system. It makes experienced
 programmers extremely productive, but it comes with an extraordinarily steep
 learning curve. Its syntax elaboration algorithm is hard to understand;
 its toolbox is large and complex; and it has some brittle, unexplored
 corners that occasionally trip up even experienced programmers.  The
 situation calls for simplifications of the syntax system and for
 the creation of a smooth ramp for the toolbox (in terms of both tools and
 documentation).</p><p>In addition, the syntax extension system does not allow for a separation of
 concerns, and programs suffer from this. For example, many programming
 languages allow programmers to separate specifications from
 implementations. In conventional Racket, contracts play the role of
 specifications, functions implement them, and programmers may choose to
 separate the two concerns in a module. No such separation exists for the
 syntax system. While Culpepper&rsquo;s dissertation&nbsp;(<a href="doc-bibliography.html#%28autobib._.Ryan._.Culpepper._and._.Matthias._.Felleisen.Fortifying._macros.In._.I.C.F.P%2C._pp..._235--2462010%29" data-pltdoc="x">Culpepper and Felleisen</a> <a href="doc-bibliography.html#%28autobib._.Ryan._.Culpepper._and._.Matthias._.Felleisen.Fortifying._macros.In._.I.C.F.P%2C._pp..._235--2462010%29" data-pltdoc="x">2010</a>)
 research has made some progress in this direction, a lot more work on
 separating syntax specifications from syntax implementations is
 needed. Realizing both will greatly improve Racket&rsquo;s support for the
 principle of language-oriented programming.</p><p>Besides a language, modern programmers need an ecosystem. Indeed, many
 programmers equate languages with their ecosystems. For Racket, this equation
 means that the creation of a new language ought to include the derivation of
 an IDE from DrRacket.  To some extent, DrRacket can already support new
 languages automatically, e.g., with on-line syntax checking and simple
 refactoring actions. For other tools, such as a syntax-directed stepper, this
 process would need a significant amount of work and comes without guidance or
 automation.<span class="refelem"><span class="refcolumn"><span class="refcontent">Spoofax&nbsp;(<a href="doc-bibliography.html#%28autobib._.Kats._.C...L..._.Lennart._and._.Eelco._.Visser.The._.Spoofax._language._workbench.In._.O.O.P.S.L.A%2C._pp..._444--4632010%29" data-pltdoc="x">Lennart and Visser</a> <a href="doc-bibliography.html#%28autobib._.Kats._.C...L..._.Lennart._and._.Eelco._.Visser.The._.Spoofax._language._workbench.In._.O.O.P.S.L.A%2C._pp..._444--4632010%29" data-pltdoc="x">2010</a>) comes with domain-specific
languages for the generation of IDE tools, but also relies on extra-linguistic
mechanisms.</span></span></span></p><p>The currently available enforcement mechanisms give rise to a full spectrum of
 conventional programming languages: Typed Racket, Racket with contracts,
 Racket, and <a href="http://docs.racket-lang.org/foreign/index.html" class="RktModLink" data-pltdoc="x"><span class="RktSym">ffi/unsafe</span></a> Racket. Although this spectrum is
 expressive, it lacks power at both ends. To achieve full control over its
 context, Racket probably needs access to assembly languages on all possible
 platforms (from hardware to the web&rsquo;s JavaScript). How to integrate this power
 in a portable manner is unclear. To realize the full power of types, Racket
 will have to be equipped with dependent types. Tobin-Hochstadt and his Typed
 Racket group are currently working on first steps in this direction, focusing
 on numeric constraints in <a href="http://docs.racket-lang.org/ts-reference/index.html" class="RktModLink" data-pltdoc="x"><span class="RktSym">typed/racket</span></a>. When a Racket program uses vectors, its
 corresponding typed variant type-checks what goes into these vectors and what
 comes out, but like ML or Haskell, indexing is left to a (contractual) check
 in the run-time system. Integrating Xi and Pfenning&rsquo;s form of programming with
 numeric constraints&nbsp;(<a href="doc-bibliography.html#%28autobib._.Hongwei._.Xi._and._.Frank._.Pfenning.Eliminating._array._bound._checking._through._dependent._types.In._.P.L.D.I%2C._pp..._249--2571998%29" data-pltdoc="x">Xi and Pfenning</a> <a href="doc-bibliography.html#%28autobib._.Hongwei._.Xi._and._.Frank._.Pfenning.Eliminating._array._bound._checking._through._dependent._types.In._.P.L.D.I%2C._pp..._249--2571998%29" data-pltdoc="x">1998</a>) into <a href="http://docs.racket-lang.org/ts-reference/index.html" class="RktModLink" data-pltdoc="x"><span class="RktSym">typed/racket</span></a> is a natural step beyond plain
 types.</p><p>More generally, Racket&rsquo;s spectrum of languages creates a multi-lingual
 world for programmers, though with far more structure than currently found
 in practice.  Even though Matthews and Findler&nbsp;(<a href="doc-bibliography.html#%28autobib._.Jacob._.Matthews._and._.Robert._.Bruce._.Findler.Operational._semantics._for._multi-language._programs.T.O.P.L.A.S._31%283%29%2C._pp..._12~3a1--12~3a442009%29" data-pltdoc="x">Matthews and Findler</a> <a href="doc-bibliography.html#%28autobib._.Jacob._.Matthews._and._.Robert._.Bruce._.Findler.Operational._semantics._for._multi-language._programs.T.O.P.L.A.S._31%283%29%2C._pp..._12~3a1--12~3a442009%29" data-pltdoc="x">2009</a>) have
 studied the basics of multi-lingual programs, their theory covers only a
 small part of this world. Our work on Racket clearly calls for extensions
 of this result in several directions, including the sound interaction
 between by-value and by-name (or lazy) variants of Racket, typed and
 dependently typed variants, and so on.  We expect that studying how to
 protect verified code as it is co-mingled with other kinds of code will
 yield new insights into Racket&rsquo;s safety mechanisms.</p><p>Racket must also broaden its horizon and consider security concerns, both
 as an enforcement action but also as an application of the third
 principle. While sandboxes address some of the security concerns of
 running a student program in a homework submission server, properly
 addressing this problem calls for articulating security policies and
 enforcing them in a system. Moore, et al.&nbsp;(<a href="doc-bibliography.html#%28autobib._.Scott._.Moore%2C._.Christos._.Dimoulas%2C._.Dan._.King%2C._and._.Stephen._.Chong.S.H.I.L.L~3a._a._secure._shell._scripting._language.In._.S.O.S.P%2C._pp..._183--1992014%29" data-pltdoc="x">Moore et al.</a> <a href="doc-bibliography.html#%28autobib._.Scott._.Moore%2C._.Christos._.Dimoulas%2C._.Dan._.King%2C._and._.Stephen._.Chong.S.H.I.L.L~3a._a._secure._shell._scripting._language.In._.S.O.S.P%2C._pp..._183--1992014%29" data-pltdoc="x">2014</a>) recently presented
 Shill, a secure scripting language implemented atop Racket. Their work
 exposed serious gaps between Racket&rsquo;s principle of language-oriented
 programming and its implementation as well as in Racket&rsquo;s approach to
 enforcing security. Once again, we consider these weaknesses an
 opportunity to improve Racket and expect to study these problems in the
 near future.</p><div class="navsetbottom"><span class="navleft"><div class="nosearchform"></div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="navright">&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="sec_feedback.html" title="backward to &quot;6 The Racket Design Feedback Loop&quot;" data-pltdoc="x">&larr; prev</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="index.html" title="up to &quot;The Racket Manifesto&quot;" data-pltdoc="x">up</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="Acknowledgments.html" title="forward to &quot;8 Acknowledgments&quot;" data-pltdoc="x">next &rarr;</a></span>&nbsp;</div></div></div><div id="contextindicator">&nbsp;</div></body></html>
