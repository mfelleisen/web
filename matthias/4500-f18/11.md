### Vote! Vote! Vote! 

You may choose one of the following options for the rest of the semester: 

- you may stick with your partner and receive a new code base ("same partner")
- you are partnered up with a new person and you may convince him/her to
  stick with your code base ("code!")

To vote for one of these choices, write down 
   
- "same partner" 
- "code!" 

on an otherwise blank sheet of paper. 

The democratic choice will apply to the entire class (both sections).
