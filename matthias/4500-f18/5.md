## Independence Day 

### By now you need to understand some terminology. 

- "server" is used for two different ideas: 
  - a module that provides services and is linked into a program 
    (usually source level)
  - a program running on a remote computer that responds to messages on "the
    wire", typically via a protocol at the TCP level or above (rarely below)

- "client" is used for two analogous ideas: 
  - a module that receives services from another module (usually in the
    same language)
  - a program that connects to another program via a "wired" protocol
    (typically at the TCP level or above)

When assignments mention this idea, you need to pay attention to the
context. You may also wish to listen in class because the relevant
information is typically re-explained there. 

### Another In-Class Exercise 

The goal is to get your `client` for assignment 4 to pass a reasonable
test within the next 45 to 60 minutes. 

- in your repo `4`, you will find a directory called `tests` with _one_
  pair of files: `1-in.json` and `1-out.json`. 

- connect your `client` program to `antarctica.ccs.neu.edu` at port 8000
  where my `server` will receive your `client`'s messages and respond 

- for all messages in error, the server will publicly display your
  `client`'s name and the failed message 

### Code Walks 

Today we practice code presentations and reviews.
