## Watch out, You may get what you wish 

### Learning 

- the point of the first two weeks is to provide you with opportunities for 
  - refreshing/consolidating your understanding of F I, II and OOD 
    - developing software by StackOverflow won't work
    - it just creates more of the code that has gotten the world into a huge
       safety and security mess
  - learning things about your chosen language that nobody will teach (not even trade schools)
  - figuring out how to find the right library on line 

- don't tell us your language can't do X 
  - I know many of the people who specified/created your languages 
  - Even if I didn't, I have run the course like this for years and
    people have raised such issues before and have resolved them 
  - Students using new languages is a rare event 

### Doing and Analyzing 

- 1 hour for trying to turn your client into an executable with the code
  provided from Codemanistan 

- IF you get (any of) the test four cases to go thru, let us know. 
- IF you don't, reflect on what is wrong with _your_ interface spec
  or explain how the amazing coders in Codemanistan misunderstood your specs
- IF the code you got is just totally wrong or non-existent, spend the hour
  on figuring out what went wrong with your specification 

### The Dress Rehearsal for the Dress Rehearsal 

- 3x a pair, pick random reviewers 

### Lessons Learned: See Above 

- F I, II, and OOD addressed every single point that went wrong
  (This is a prediction, and I will amend this statement if I see something
  different.)
