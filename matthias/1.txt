Develop the program 'quality' in your favorite language,
which measures some properties of programs. For now, 
'quality' merely determines the average length of the 
lines of code in a program in your chosen language. To 
allow programmers extensive commenting, it ignores all
lines that start with the comment character. 

Programmers will run 'quality' from the command line and
pipe in raw text files. Here is the command if you were
to run 'quality' in a Unix-style context: 

 $ ./quality.py < quality.py 

[assuming that Python is your favorite language]. 

-------------------------------------------------------
Question What will 'quality do when a user pipes in 
 a text file? 

Answer It will interpret it as a code file in your
favorite language and produce a nonsense output.
