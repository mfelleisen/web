second release <br/>

Shriram, Ben Greenman, Vincent St-Amour, Matthew, and Arjun pushed
back, questioned my write-up, reinforced some points, and also pointed
out typos. So this is a major rewrite.</p><p class="SHistory">Changed in version 1.0: Thu Apr 16 11:10:29 EDT 2020,
first release <br/></p><p>This spring semester I taught the undergraduate programming language
course&#8212;<wbr></wbr>titled &ldquo;Principles of Programming Languages&rdquo; (PPL) &#8212;<wbr></wbr>for the
first time in 18 years. Before that I had taught this course for 14 years
in a row, with one break for a sabbatical.</p><p><span class="refelem"><span class="refcolumn"><span class="refcontent">They may only think they wish to become developers. We
still owe them a chance.</span></span></span>  Since 2002, I have continued to develop an
<a href="./Developing_Developers.html">undergraduate core curriculum that focuses on systematic
software design.</a> My take is that 99% of our undergraduate students
wish to become software developer, and it is our job to prepare them as
well as possible.</p><h4>1<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.Why_.Do_.We_.Teach_.P.L)"></a>Why Do We Teach PL</h4><p>Some instructors want to show students what their favorite language can do
for them. Others wish to expose their class to ideas that are of exciting
to them. Some hold a near-religious belief about the landscape of
programming languages and how people <span class="emph">must</span> view it.  If you belong to one of
these groups, this note is not for you.</p><p><div class="SIntrapara">By contrast, I expect PPL to play two roles in the core of the curriculum:
</div><div class="SIntrapara"><ul><li><p>PPL is primarily an introduction to the fundamental principles of
the PL landscape that every developer must understand.</p></li><li><p>PPL should once again reinforce the lessons of our
 developer-oriented curriculum.</p><p>The researchers in programming languages&#8212;<wbr></wbr>the oldest area in computer
science&#8212;<wbr></wbr>have developed the deepest understanding of the development of
programs. This understanding deeply informs the design of our
curriculum. The assignments in this course will reinforce these lessons and
demonstrate their usefulness.</p></li></ul></div></p><h4>2<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.Transfer)"></a>Transfer</h4><p>When I started teaching PPL with <a href="http://www.eopl3.com">EOPL</a> at Rice in 1987, it was obvious
to me that students would easily be able to apply what I taught
them. Like everyone else, I had anecdotes.</p><p><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="boxed"><tr><td><p>In 1988, I had a vocal a senior who expressed his doubts about the
usefulness of the material in class. A short time after graduating, I bumped into him&#8212;<wbr></wbr>and he
couldn&rsquo;t stop telling me about how my course material had saved him
with the very first task on his very first job. His manager had
asked him to translate a mathematical algorithm, adaptive integration,
into a FORTRAN library. Back then FORTRAN did not support recursion,
but the student remembered how we systematically transformed recursive
interpreters into imperative loop-oriented code. So he pulled out his
course notes, formulated the mathematics in Scheme, applied the
<a href="http://www.eopl3.com">EoPL</a> method, and voil&#224;, he had his FORTRAN code.</p></td></tr></table></p><p><span class="refelem"><span class="refcolumn"><span class="refcontent">I didn&rsquo;t use the word &ldquo;transfer&rdquo; back then.</span></span></span>  We all
have such anecdotes. I have quite a few more. But, we train hundreds
of students and we don&rsquo;t hear from more than a few. In the mid 1990s,
I started to have doubts about <span class="emph">transfer</span>, triggered by observations in
my PPL course.</p><p><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="boxed" style="border-collapse: collapse;"><tr><td valign="top" width="280" style="border-bottom: 1px solid black;; padding: 10px;"><p>What problem did you observe? </p></td><td valign="top" width="280" style="border-bottom: 1px solid black;; padding: 10px;"><p> In &rsquo;94 we started teaching

How come? </p></td><td valign="top" width="280" style="border-bottom: 1px solid black;; padding: 10px;"><p> Some students told me so. They couldn&rsquo;t imagine using the

<a href="./Developing_Developers.html">undergraduate core curriculum</a> in three different languages
and settings. And that&rsquo;s half the reason I hadn&rsquo;t taught PPL in 18 years.</span></span></span></p><p>A couple of years ago I also had some conversations with Shriram on
students&rsquo; understanding of aliasing. He observed that his incoming PPL
students did not have a firm grasp of the idea, regardless of
syntax. Over the course of PPL, they improved their
understanding&#8212;<wbr></wbr>but only in the syntax that he taught.</p><h4>3<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.My_.Approach)"></a>My Approach</h4><p><div class="SIntrapara">When the College asked me to teach PPL this spring, I decided to
address &ldquo;transfer&rdquo; explicitly. I did not want to improve their
understanding of PPL ideas in my favorite language but in theirs. So,
I decided to run <a href="/matthias/4400-s20/index.html">my course</a> like this:
</div><div class="SIntrapara"><ul><li><p>let students work in their &ldquo;favorite&rdquo; language</p></li><li><p>use Racket in lectures as my &ldquo;second favorite&rdquo; language</p></li><li><p>dispatch with parsing as a &ldquo;model view control&rdquo; problem</p></li><li><p>work exclusively with abstract syntax (structs, not
S-expressions)</p></li><li><p>deliver lecture code in a functional style but occasionally give
direct reminders on how this would work in an object-oriented language</p></li><li><p>have the students present and explain their solutions in class.</p></li></ul></div></p><p>A large number of students chose Java, the language of our second and
third course. An equally large number opted for Python.  Otherwise
there were a handful of (Typed) Racket pairs, and one each of Haskell,
Rust, and TypeScript. One pair started in OCaml but switched to Typed
Racket after one assignment.</p><p>The concrete input syntax was <span style="font-weight: bold">JSON</span>, though I mostly used nested
arrays. To drive home the idea of abstract syntax, one homework
assignment had the students parse two <span class="emph">different</span> concrete
syntaxes into the <span class="emph">same</span> abstract syntax; the homework pointed
them to a web repository with <span style="font-weight: bold">S-expression</span> parsers for every
one of the chosen languages.</p><p>I posed another homework problem that explicitly addressed
&ldquo;transfer.&rdquo;  It asked the students to write a &ldquo;transpiler&rdquo; from
JSON to programs in their chosen language. They had to measure for how
many of around 100 tests their interpreter and their transpiled
programs produced the same outputs. Below I refer to this as Homework
8 (HW8).</p><p>I specifically worked on aliasing with three different homework
assignment that forced them to work through the idea at all levels:
test programs, their own programming language, and the
environment-store distinction. The good students clearly grokked
it&#8212;<wbr></wbr>and they may have without this re-design. But near the end of the
semester, I started to identify a problem among the weak part of my
class; their questions suggested that they still had a hard time
separating static scope/environment from dynamic effect/store and
dynamic extent/continuation.  A conversation with Ben Lerner, who
taught compilers in parallel with few students in both classes,
reinforced this impression. Perhaps aliasing is just really really
hard, and Shriram may have put his fingers on the sorest spot of all.</p><h4>4<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.Student_.Response)"></a>Student Response</h4><p>I wanted to explore several aspects with Piazza polls once the pandemic hit
but in the end I left it at three. As in ordinary elections, only
about half the students voted though Piazza says that almost all of
them looked at the posts.</p><p>The first question that interested me concerned the choice of programming
language. As you can tell from <a href="#%28counter._%28figure._fig~3alanguage%29%29" data-pltdoc="x">figure&nbsp;<span class="FigureRef">1</span></a> students supported
this option with an overwhelming majority. But, to my surprise, a fair
number voted for an option that I added as a teaser&#8212;<wbr></wbr>have the instructor
pick a number of languages. Only one (1!) person voted for letting the
instructor choose a single language.</p><blockquote class="Figure"><blockquote class="Centerfigure"><blockquote class="FigureInside"><p><img style="vertical-align: -0.0px; margin: -3px -3px -3px -3px;" src="pict.png" alt="image" width="625.914990234375" height="303.0"/></p></blockquote></blockquote><p class="Centertext"><span class="Legend"><span class="FigureTarget"><a name="(counter._(figure._fig~3alanguage))" x-target-lift="Figure"></a>Figure&nbsp;1: </span>In which language do students wish to program?</span></p></blockquote><p>Due to network problems, one of my teaching assistants turned a
lecture in mid April into a conversation. She asked students whether
they would use the same programming language again. All Java and
Python programmer who responded said they would not use these
languages again. Not everybody responded to her question, though.</p><p>The second question was about the input language. Frankly, I had hoped that
the exercise on S-expression had convinced them of the cleanliness of
S-expression over JSON.  Well, <a href="#%28counter._%28figure._fig~3ajson%29%29" data-pltdoc="x">figure&nbsp;<span class="FigureRef">2</span></a> tells you that they
love what they (think they) know.</p><blockquote class="Figure"><blockquote class="Centerfigure"><blockquote class="FigureInside"><p><img style="vertical-align: -0.0px; margin: -3px -3px -3px -3px;" src="pict_2.png" alt="image" width="656.375859375" height="303.0"/></p></blockquote></blockquote><p class="Centertext"><span class="Legend"><span class="FigureTarget"><a name="(counter._(figure._fig~3ajson))" x-target-lift="Figure"></a>Figure&nbsp;2: </span>What kind of input language should the course use?</span></p></blockquote><p>For the third question, I allowed students to check multiple options. The
goal was to find out whether explicitly talking about transfer and
explicitly assigning <a href="/matthias/4400-s20/8.html">a &ldquo;transfer homework&rdquo;</a> had helped. I
think <a href="#%28counter._%28figure._fig~3aconcepts%29%29" data-pltdoc="x">figure&nbsp;<span class="FigureRef">3</span></a> leaves no doubt about how students feel.</p><blockquote class="Figure"><blockquote class="Centerfigure"><blockquote class="FigureInside"><p><img style="vertical-align: -0.0px; margin: -3px -3px -3px -3px;" src="pict_3.png" alt="image" width="634.88203125" height="303.0"/></p></blockquote></blockquote><p class="Centertext"><span class="Legend"><span class="FigureTarget"><a name="(counter._(figure._fig~3aconcepts))" x-target-lift="Figure"></a>Figure&nbsp;3: </span>What helps with the transfer of knowledge?</span></p></blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: bold">&ldquo;Feel&rdquo;</span> I used the word &ldquo;feel&rdquo; here because I am perfectly
aware that a Piazza poll is <span class="emph">not</span> scientific evidence. It does
provide us with an impression of how students perceive the course and
possibly suggests that explicitly addressing their hearts and minds
helps them learn. And that may help us teach.</p><h4>5<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.Postscript__.Call_.C.C)"></a>Postscript: Call/CC</h4><p>I could not stomach asking my teaching assistants to grade cps-ed Java
programs. So instead I pursued the following path.</p><p>First, I asked the students to implement a cps transpiler for our model
language. I really like <a href="/matthias/4400-s20/lecture20.html">the way I taught cps-ing</a> this year.</p><p>Second, for the last few weeks I switched from interpreters to C, CC,
CEK, and CESK machines. I wanted to figure out how that went over but
due to the pandemic they worked through just two homework assignments
with abstract machines. And I could not figure out how to ask them to
compare the approaches.&#8212;<wbr></wbr>Others have reported that they use a
machine-based approach with success, so it is clearly time to
re-balance the topics.</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold">Acknowledgments</span> Conversations with Shriram on his PL course
reinforced my desire to try this approach. &ldquo;Coffees&rdquo; with my current PhD
students plus Jason Hemann and Ben Lerner served as a sounding board during
the entire fall 2019 semester. Their comments helped me shape several
elements; Michael Ballantyne&rsquo;s encouragement to switch to abstract machines
at the end helped me make the move that I had imagined ever since I wrote
the Redex book with Matthew and Robby.</p><p>Teaching such a course requires an outstanding team of assistants. I
was blessed to work with Leif Andersen, Suzanne Becker, Julia
Belyakova, and Dustin Jamner.</p><div class="navsetbottom"><span class="navleft"><div class="nosearchform"></div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="navright">&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="index.html" title="backward to &quot;Thoughts&quot;" data-pltdoc="x">&larr; prev</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="index.html" title="up to &quot;Thoughts&quot;" data-pltdoc="x">up</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="NSF.html" title="forward to &quot;NSF&quot;" data-pltdoc="x">next &rarr;</a></span>&nbsp;</div></div></div><div id="contextindicator">&nbsp;</div></body></html>
