in version 1.0: Thu Apr 16 11:10:29 EDT 2020,
first release <br/></p><p>This spring semester I taught the undergraduate programming language
course&#8212;<wbr></wbr>titled &ldquo;Principles of Programming Languages&rdquo; (PPL) &#8212;<wbr></wbr>for the
first time in 18 years. Before that I had taught this course for 14 years
in a row, with one break for a sabbatical.</p><p>Since 2002, I have continued to develop an <a href="./Developing_Developers.html">undergraduate core
curriculum that emphasizes the training of developers.</a> My take is that 99%
of our undergraduate students wish to have the chance to become a
developer, and it is our job to give them the best possible preparation. I
am reasonably satisfied with the progress we have made.  (Once we give them
the chance to work for top-tier software companies, it is up to them to say
&ldquo;no&rdquo; and become doll makers. Or whatever.)</p><h4>1<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.Why_.Do_.We_.Teach_.P.L)"></a>Why Do We Teach PL</h4><p>I consider the programming languages course a building block in this
&ldquo;prepare them for a job&rdquo; curriculum. But I understand that people teach
an undergraduate course on programming languages for many different
reasons.</p><p>Some instructors want to show students what their favorite language can do
for them. Others wish to expose their class to ideas that are of exciting
to them. Some hold a near-religious belief about the landscape of
programming languages and how people <span class="emph">must</span> view it.  If you belong to one of
these groups, this note is not for you.</p><p><div class="SIntrapara">By contrast I expect this course to play two roles:
</div><div class="SIntrapara"><ul><li><p>It is primarily an introduction to the fundamental ideas of
programming languages that every developer must understand, those that end
up working in C#, JavaScript, Haskell, Rust, or some other language.</p></li><li><p>It also reinforce the lessons of our core curriculum.</p><p>The researchers in programming languages&#8212;<wbr></wbr>the oldest area in computer
science&#8212;<wbr></wbr>have developed the deepest understanding of the development of
programs. This understanding deeply informs the design of our
curriculum. The assignments in this course will reinforce these lessons and
demonstrate their usefulness.</p></li></ul></div></p><h4>2<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.Transfer)"></a>Transfer</h4><p>A problem that I have had with the way I taught PPL in the first 14 years
of my career is that I never knew whether students could transfer the
concepts from class to the languages they wanted to&#8212;<wbr></wbr>or had
to&#8212;<wbr></wbr>use.</p><p>Several conversations with Shriram on students&rsquo; understanding of aliasing
only reinforced this troubling thought.</p><h4>3<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.My_.Approach)"></a>My Approach</h4><p><div class="SIntrapara">So, I decided to run <a href="/matthias/4400-s20/index.html">my course</a> like this:
</div><div class="SIntrapara"><ul><li><p>let students work in their &ldquo;favorite&rdquo; language</p></li><li><p>use Racket in lectures as my &ldquo;second favorite&rdquo; language</p></li><li><p>explicitly work with abstract syntax (structs, not S-expressions;
strings rarely symbols) only after dispatching with parsing as a &ldquo;model
view control&rdquo; problem</p></li><li><p>prefer the functional style but occasionally give direct or indirect
reminders on how this would work in an object-oriented language.</p></li></ul></div></p><p>Not surprisingly, a large number of students chose Java the language of our
second and third course, which many had just completed. An equally large
number opted for Python of course.  Otherwise there were a handful of
(Typed) Racket pairs, and one each of Haskell, Rust, and TypeScript. One
pair started in OCaml and, after reading the first or second homework
assignment, switched to Typed Racket.</p><p>The concrete input syntax was <span style="font-weight: bold">JSON</span>, though I mostly used nested
arrays. Imagine S-expressions with strings instead of symbols and commas
everywhere. &#8212;<wbr></wbr> To drive home the idea of abstract syntax, one homework
assignment pointed them to a web page with <span style="font-weight: bold">S-expression</span> parsers for
every one of the chosen languages and asked to parse two <span class="emph">different</span>
concrete syntax choices into the <span class="emph">same</span> abstract syntax.</p><p>I addressed the &ldquo;transfer problem&rdquo; head-on with an assignment that asked
to write a &ldquo;transpiler&rdquo; that translates the JSON input programs for their
interpreters to programs in their chosen language. They had to measure for
how many of around 100 tests their interpreter and their transpiled
programs produced the same outputs. Below I refer to this as Homework 8 (HW8).</p><p><div class="SIntrapara">I specifically worked on aliasing with three different homework assignment
that forced them to work through the idea at all levels: test programs,
their own programming language, and the environment-store distinction. The
good students clearly grokked it&#8212;<wbr></wbr>and they may have without this
re-design. But near the end of the semester, I started to identify a
problem among the weak part of my class: </div><div class="SIntrapara"><blockquote><p>their
questions suggested that they still had a hard time separating static
scope/environment from dynamic effect/store and dynamic
extent/continuation.</p></blockquote></div><div class="SIntrapara">  A conversation with Ben Lerner, who taught compilers
in parallel with few students in both classes, reinforced this
impression. Perhaps it&rsquo;s just really really hard.</div></p><h4>4<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.Student_.Response)"></a>Student Response</h4><p>I wanted to explore several aspects with Piazza polls once the pandemic hit
but in the end I left it at three. As always, only about half the students
voted though Piazza says that almost all of them looked at the post. I
wonder what non-voting means here.</p><blockquote class="Figure"><blockquote class="Centerfigure"><blockquote class="FigureInside"><p><img style="vertical-align: -0.0px; margin: -3px -3px -3px -3px;" src="pict.png" alt="image" width="625.914990234375" height="303.0"/></p></blockquote></blockquote><p class="Centertext"><span class="Legend"><span class="FigureTarget"><a name="(counter._(figure._fig~3alanguage))" x-target-lift="Figure"></a>Figure&nbsp;1: </span>In which language do students wish to program?</span></p></blockquote><p>The first question that interested me concerned the choice of programming
language. As you can tell from <a href="#%28counter._%28figure._fig~3alanguage%29%29" data-pltdoc="x">figure&nbsp;<span class="FigureRef">1</span></a> students supported
this option with an overwhelming majority. But, to my surprise, a fair
number voted for an option that I added as a teaser&#8212;<wbr></wbr>have the instructor
pick a number of languages. Only one (1!) person voted for letting the
instructor choose.</p><blockquote class="Figure"><blockquote class="Centerfigure"><blockquote class="FigureInside"><p><img style="vertical-align: -0.0px; margin: -3px -3px -3px -3px;" src="pict_2.png" alt="image" width="656.375859375" height="303.0"/></p></blockquote></blockquote><p class="Centertext"><span class="Legend"><span class="FigureTarget"><a name="(counter._(figure._fig~3ajson))" x-target-lift="Figure"></a>Figure&nbsp;2: </span>What kind of input language should the course use?</span></p></blockquote><p>The second question was about the input language. Frankly, I had hoped that
the exercise on S-expression had convinced them of the cleanliness of
S-expression over JSON.  Well, <a href="#%28counter._%28figure._fig~3ajson%29%29" data-pltdoc="x">figure&nbsp;<span class="FigureRef">2</span></a> tells you that they
love what they (think they) know.</p><blockquote class="Figure"><blockquote class="Centerfigure"><blockquote class="FigureInside"><p><img style="vertical-align: -0.0px; margin: -3px -3px -3px -3px;" src="pict_3.png" alt="image" width="634.88203125" height="303.0"/></p></blockquote></blockquote><p class="Centertext"><span class="Legend"><span class="FigureTarget"><a name="(counter._(figure._fig~3aconcepts))" x-target-lift="Figure"></a>Figure&nbsp;3: </span>What helps with the transfer of knowledge?</span></p></blockquote><p>For the third question, I allowed students to check multiple options. The
goal was to find out whether explicitly talking about transfer and
explicitly assigning <a href="/matthias/4400-s20/8.html">a &ldquo;transfer homework&rdquo;</a> had helped. I
think <a href="#%28counter._%28figure._fig~3aconcepts%29%29" data-pltdoc="x">figure&nbsp;<span class="FigureRef">3</span></a> leaves now doubt about how students feel.</p><h5>4.1<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.Feel)"></a>Feel</h5><p>I used the word &ldquo;feel&rdquo; here because I am perfectly aware that a Piazza
poll is <span class="emph">not</span> scientific evidence. It does provide us with an
impression of how students perceive the course and possibly suggests that
explicitly addressing their hearts and minds helps them learn. And that may
help us teach.</p><h4>5<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.Postscript__.Call_.C.C)"></a>Postscript: Call/CC</h4><p>I could not stomach asking my teaching assistants to grade cps-ed Java
programs. So instead I pursued the following path.</p><p>First, I asked the students to implement a cps transpiler for our model
language. I really like <a href="/matthias/4400-s20/lecture20.html">the way I taught cps-ing</a> this year.</p><p>Second, for the last few weeks I switched from interpreters to C, CC, CEK,
and CESK machines. I wanted to figure out how that went over but due to the
pandemic they worked through just two homework assignments with abstract
machines. And frankly, I didn&rsquo;t know how to ask them about the abstract
machine topic.</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold">Acknowledgments</span> Conversations with Shriram on his PL course
reinforced my desire to try this approach. &ldquo;Coffees&rdquo; with my current PhD
students plus Jason Heman and Ben Lerner served as a sounding board during
the entire fall 2019 semester. Their comments helped me shape several
elements; Michael Ballantyne&rsquo;s encouragement to switch to abstract machines
at the end helped me make the move that I had imagined ever since I wrote
the Redex book with Matthew and Robby.</p><div class="navsetbottom"><span class="navleft"><div class="nosearchform"></div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="navright">&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="index.html" title="backward to &quot;Thoughts&quot;" data-pltdoc="x">&larr; prev</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="index.html" title="up to &quot;Thoughts&quot;" data-pltdoc="x">up</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="NSF.html" title="forward to &quot;NSF&quot;" data-pltdoc="x">next &rarr;</a></span>&nbsp;</div></div></div><div id="contextindicator">&nbsp;</div></body></html>
