Conferences are poisoning computer science. Well, at least programming
languages. I have written many emails about this topic and I got the POPL
community to discuss the issue in Madrid but boy it is difficult to change
people’s habits. One day I will write a coherent document. 

For now, I am referring you to Allessio Guglielmi. Sadly, I have already
been following his guideline about submitting to conferences only when I
wish to publish with and for my students—with the exception of the 2009
ICFP paper. It doesn’t help; it’s still way too much.
