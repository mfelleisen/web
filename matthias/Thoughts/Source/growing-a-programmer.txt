Growing a Programmer 

Northeastern's computer science curriculum is unique in the nation.  It is
the only approach to programming that focuses on explicit and systematic
problem solving. Instead of the currently fashionable programming language.
it initially uses a simple notation tailored to the curricular goals. 
Follow-up courses then programming explain how to apply these principles to
languages used in industry and how these problem-solving principles enable 
logical reasoning.

In parallel these courses send the message that the programming is a people
discipline. From the very first day, students never work alone, but in
pairs. They are thus forced to learn how to articulate their thoughts about
problems and solutions. Downstream courses also teach students how to
present their ideas to large groups and how to listen and evaluate such
presentations. 

A Northeastern computer science major is equally well prepared to become a
software engineer, a surgeon, or a supply-chain manager. Many will end up
being CEOs.
