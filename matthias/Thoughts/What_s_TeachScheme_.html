the <span style="font-style: italic">TeachScheme!</span> curriculum. I cannot eliminate these misunderstandings in a single
conversation, but I can at least spell them out and address them here. I
did so with a <span style="font-style: italic">Little LISPer</span> style dialog, though it can also be
read as a FAQ list.</p><p>(Note: My dialog supplements and does not compete or conflict with
<a href="http://www.teach-scheme.org/Notes/">the section on frequently
asked questions</a> at our <span style="font-style: italic">TeachScheme!</span> site.)</p><p><table cellspacing="0" cellspacing="10" cellpadding="10"><tr><td valign="top" width="500"><p><span style="font-weight: bold">Q: </span>Is <span style="font-style: italic">TeachScheme!</span> about Scheme?</p></td><td valign="top" width="500"><p><span style="font-weight: bold">A: </span>No, <span style="font-style: italic">TeachScheme!</span> is about the systematic design of programs from the very
beginning, regardless of programming language.</p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" width="500"><p><span style="font-weight: bold">Q: </span>So why do you use Scheme?</p></td><td valign="top" width="500"><p><span style="font-weight: bold">A: </span>We don&rsquo;t. The "!" signals <span style="font-style: italic">not</span>,
because we <span style="font-style: italic">really</span> do <span style="font-style: italic">not</span> use Scheme. We also don&rsquo;t use
Racket, our own language, which is a flavor of LISP and Scheme.</p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" width="500"><p><span style="font-weight: bold">Q: </span>What do you use?</p></td><td valign="top" width="500"><p><span style="font-weight: bold">A: </span>We use a series of teaching languages, with each successor a bit more
expressive than its predecessor. These teaching languages borrow elements
from Racket, a member of the LISP family of languages. That&rsquo;s why our
programs use all these parentheses.</p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" width="500"><p><span style="font-weight: bold">Q: </span>Is the <span style="font-style: italic">TeachScheme!</span> idea of design really useful in all kinds of programming
languages?</p></td><td valign="top" width="500"><p><span style="font-weight: bold">A: </span>Yes, it is. Over the years, I have had students who applied the design
recipe and the design guidelines in all kinds of languages: assembly,
Python, Perl, Ruby, and Java. Indeed, I know instructors for each of these
languages who adopted the design recipe for their languages &ndash; after
starting their students on plain <a href="http://www.htdp.org">HtDP</a>.</p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" width="500"><p><span style="font-weight: bold">Q: </span>Okay, so <span style="font-style: italic">TeachScheme!</span> isn&rsquo;t about Scheme. Is it about functional
programming?</p></td><td valign="top" width="500"><p><span style="font-weight: bold">A: </span>No, <span style="font-style: italic">TeachScheme!</span> is about the systematic design of <span style="font-style: italic">all</span> kinds of
programs. That includes object-oriented and imperative programs.</p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" width="500"><p><span style="font-weight: bold">Q: </span>Why are most of the early programs in a functional style?</p></td><td valign="top" width="500"><p><span style="font-weight: bold">A: </span>We consider the functional style of programming the best starting point
for two reasons. To start with, our decision is based on many years of
experience with designing large systems in assembly, Pascal, C, and with
teaching in similar languages. Functional programming is easier than
anything else. Most importantly, functional programming focuses
programmers on values, the fact that every function should produce a
value, and that this value can be tested for correctness. </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" width="500"><p><span style="font-weight: bold">Q: </span>And the second reason?</p></td><td valign="top" width="500"><p><span style="font-weight: bold">A: </span>We really do consider the functional style of programming the proper
starting point in middle school and high school. When you teach
programming there, a functional approach has numerous, beneficial side
effects. In middle school, it reinforces algebra and clarifies that
you can create animations, games, and all kinds of fun and relevant
products with algebra, not just calculate when trains leaving Pittsburgh
and Philadelphia meet and crash. In high school, functional programming is
in a symbiosis with trigonometry and geometry; with (pre)calculus and
logic; and even with sciences that use mathematical models (physics,
economics).</p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" width="500"><p><span style="font-weight: bold">Q: </span>Should everyone use functional programming for all projects?</p></td><td valign="top" width="500"><p><span style="font-weight: bold">A: </span>No way! We are not functional ideologues; Racket &ndash; our language of
choice &ndash; supports assignable variables, mutable structures and objects,
iterative constructs, etc. Every programmer should think functionally and
start functionally, but it is critical to know when assignment and
mutation are needed. That ensures that they are used properly.</p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" width="500"><p><span style="font-weight: bold">Q: </span>But the imperative-iterative style is so common. Why shouldn&rsquo;t we show
novices the most common style?</p></td><td valign="top" width="500"><p><span style="font-weight: bold">A: </span>Our experience shows that a prior understanding of functional style
produces significantly stronger programmers than an immediate immersion
into the OOP monoculture.</p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" width="500"><p><span style="font-weight: bold">Q: </span>Couldn&rsquo;t this just mean that a good programmer must have studied
several different languages?</p></td><td valign="top" width="500"><p><span style="font-weight: bold">A: </span>That&rsquo;s precisely what it means. Some universities, e.g., CMU and
Harvard, swap the order. They teach conventional programming first and use
an HtDP-like approach for the second course. The key is, however, that the
students produce more than a dozen or two dozen lines of code in either
style; they produce large programs in both.</p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" width="500"><p><span style="font-weight: bold">Q: </span>Aren&rsquo;t your students at a disadvantage when it comes to internships?</p></td><td valign="top" width="500"><p><span style="font-weight: bold">A: </span>Yes and no. Yes, because we consider it a <span style="font-style: italic">bad thing</span> to send
students into the real world with one course in programming under their
belt. What would you say if your pharmacist hired a student after a single
semester of chemistry?</p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" width="500"><p><span style="font-weight: bold">Q: </span>And no?</p></td><td valign="top" width="500"><p><span style="font-weight: bold">A: </span>No, because my experience at Northeastern &ndash; even more than at Rice,
which attracts top-tier students like MIT and CalTech &ndash; suggests the exact
opposite. After the introduction of the <span style="font-style: italic">TeachScheme!</span> curriculum, our students found
<span style="font-style: italic">more</span> programming co-op positions <span class="refelem"><span class="refcolumn"><span class="refcontent">A co-op position is
an actual paid employment and our co-op employers systematically report
back on the work and the quality of the work that our co-ops perform.</span></span></span>
and our co-op employers expressed extreme satisfaction. Indeed, they
complained that our MS students were worse program designers than our
junior undergraduate co-ops. I can&rsquo;t think of a better confirmation than
that.</p></td></tr></table></p><p><span class="refelem"><span class="refcolumn"><span class="refcontent">I have another essay in draft form on the topic of
the <span style="font-style: italic">TeachScheme!</span> curriculum and co-ops. I&rsquo;ll polish it up soon.</span></span></span></p><p>To really understand why these prejudices &ndash; and it is difficult to call
them anything else &ndash; are wrong, people will need to teach a course that
covers the entire HtDP curriculum and ideally a bridge to a regular OOP
course. I personally see the pay-off of our curriculum in a junior course
on software construction. In that course students construct programs of
10,000&ndash;15,000 lines of code and maintain them over the course of a
semester.</p><div class="navsetbottom"><span class="navleft">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="navright"><a href="index.html" title="backward to &quot;Thoughts&quot;" pltdoc="x">&larr; prev</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="index.html" title="up to &quot;Thoughts&quot;" pltdoc="x">up</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="Danger__unsafe_languages.html" title="forward to &quot;2 Danger: unsafe languages&quot;" pltdoc="x">next &rarr;</a></span>&nbsp;</div></div></div><div id="contextindicator">&nbsp;</div></body></html>
