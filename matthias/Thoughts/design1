@margin-note*{In his book ``The Mythical Man-Month'' Fred Brooks describes and
contrasts these forms of programming on the first pages. In addition to
``garage programming'' and a ``programming product,'' he also recognizes
``component programming'' and ``systems programming.'' This book is about the
``programming products;'' our next two books will cover ``components'' and
``systems'' design.}
