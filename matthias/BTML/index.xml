<p>The book, written in the style of <a href = "../BTLS">The Little
Schemer,</a> introduces instructors, students, and practicioners to
type-directed functional programming.  It covers basic types, quickly moves
into datatypes, and ends with a coverage of functional programming with
modules. The book uses a minimal core of SML, which can easily be
translated into the various ML dialects (SML/NJ, CAML).  Enjoy!</p>
