highly intensive software course. In this course, students work on a large-ish
project; develop several components that must interact; meet several deadlines;
and learn to research for building blocks on their own. It is a course that
teaches more than programming but not yet software engineering at scale. It is a
course on software development.</p><p>In a <span class="emph">programming</span> course, students write programs that neither they nor
anyone else ever looks at again after the grading is done. A course on
<span class="emph">software development</span> differs in that students must maintain code beyond
the first time they deliver it: react to new test cases; fix bugs; add
functionality. Ideally, this revisiting of code should happen several
times. <span class="emph">Software engineering</span> courses should go beyond code maintenance and
cover work in teams, meaning it may involve the entire class as one team; work on
extremely large code bases, meaning code that students cannot produce in a
single semester; work on problems whose solutions require trade-offs, meaning
features vs time, central algorithms optimized for space,  time, or energy; and perhaps
on special industrial topics.</p><p><div class="SIntrapara">This book is a guide to the principles of software development for instructors,
students, and even developers. As a guide to a software development course, its
central premises are as follows:
</div><div class="SIntrapara"><ul><li><p>software is a message from one developer to another across time;</p></li><li><p>the students&rsquo; programming must account for this &ldquo;messaging;&rdquo;</p></li><li><p>the instructor must run a semester-long project that creates stress
situations (deadlines, rotating partners, switching code bases) so that (1)
students demonstrate &ldquo;design under pressure&rdquo; and (2) they learn to appreciate
what &ldquo;messaging&rdquo; implies.</p></li></ul></div><div class="SIntrapara">Concisely put, software development is the first course in the curriculum that
puts the human being into the center of activity, and doing so, must become a
part of the students&rsquo; thinking.</div></p><p>Clearly, thinking is the difficult part of software development, especially
expressing thinking clearly and reflecting this clarity in the code. This course
aims to implement &ldquo;thinking&rdquo; as social processes so</p><p><div class="SIntrapara"><ul><li><p>developers must pair-program to continuously check their thinking;</p></li><li><p>pairs must submit their work for inspections to avoid &ldquo;pair think;&rdquo;</p></li><li><p>students must learn to ask hard questions about other students&rsquo; code.</p></li></ul></div><div class="SIntrapara">In short, the goal of the course is to develop a mindset that coding is a social
process of several dimensions: the immediate pair-programming partner; the
review panel; the teammate who takes over the module; the future developer who
in two decades from now fixes bugs and adds features.  Instructors coach
students to develop this mindset of programming socially and in a socially
responsible manner.</div></p><p>For working developers, the book is a help if they missed a course on software
development in their education. While reading the book isn&rsquo;t the same as working
through the project under the guidance of an instructor, developers should be
able to relate the ideas to their hands-on experiences with projects.</p><h5 class="heading"><a name="(part._skills)"></a>Developing a Mind Set<span class="button-group"><a href="#(part._skills)" class="heading-anchor" title="Link to here">ðŸ”—</a><span style="visibility: hidden"> </span></span></h5><p><div class="SIntrapara">The goal is to develop a mind set about software development that focuses on two
imperatives:
</div><div class="SIntrapara"><ul><li><p>develop software in a systematic fashion, and</p></li><li><p>develop software with, <span class="emph">and for</span>, other developers.</p></li></ul></div><div class="SIntrapara">While it is easy and good to act responsibly with immediate colleagues&#8212;<wbr></wbr>to be
&ldquo;nice&rdquo; to them&#8212;<wbr></wbr>socially responsible software development really means far
more than that. It is about treating the colleagues of the near and distant
future as respected partners in a dialogue. They are people who depend on our
effort to express our &ldquo;message&rdquo; systematically, as clearly as possible&#8212;<wbr></wbr>so
that we don&rsquo;t waste massive amounts of their time in the future when a bit of
investment on our side will help.</div></p><p>In other words, the two imperatives are intertwined. Systematic software
development means a lot of hard thinking, which happens in the developer&rsquo;s mind.
No software tools in even the best interactive development environments check
the <span class="emph">thinking</span> of a developer.  They can&rsquo;t. It takes another human being to
make sure the thinking is on the right track, and that this thinking is
systematically expressed in code.</p><p>On the flip side is the developer who is tasked with fixing a bug in old code or
with adding a new feature. Nobody can fix code without some minimal
comprehension of the software system&rsquo;s organization, the purpose of each of its
pieces, and the code in the relevant pieces.  It takes time to read and
comprehend code&#8212;<wbr></wbr>often much more time than the fix or the addition
itself. Although some emerging software tools can assist with the mechanics of
this task, systematically developed code and thinking properly presented as code
has a huge advantage here. It reduces the time needed for this critical, and it
simultaneously reduces negative feelings toward the creation that this
&ldquo;maintenance developer&rdquo; has toward the code base.</p><p>Students must experience both sides of this coin. On the producer side, they
must develop code with partners. Partners must learn to critique each other and
to learn from critique from the rest of the class, which represents their
team. The partner and the class represent future developers and maintainers. On
the consumer side, students must expect to switch partners and to take over
someone else&rsquo;s code base.</p><p>In short, changing students&rsquo; mindset requires hard work on managing continuous
and intense feedback from each other. While programming must happen in pairs,
code inspections must be public and must be solo-performances. To motivate the
latter, a code inspection starts with &ldquo;assume your partner has left the team.&rdquo;
Solo presentations check whether each partner completely understands the code
base, so that if one of them leaves, the other one isn&rsquo;t lost. Similarly, some
of the students must play the role of colleagues who take over the code.
These peers also represent the future, unmet developers and maintainers. It is
therefor their task to ask penetrating and potentially unpleasant questions
about every aspect of the design and the code. Without exception, such
interactions can lead to unhappy conversations. Yet, they are for the benefit of
the future developer and for the students&rsquo; way of thinking about their
profession.</p><p>Being socially responsible even in just our profession is hard. Practice makes
perfect&#8212;<wbr></wbr>or at least good. It is the instructor&rsquo;s job is to make sure that the
practice is done right. This book is also a guide to this job.</p><blockquote class="Figure"><blockquote class="Centerfigure"><blockquote class="FigureInside"><blockquote class="SCentered"><p><img style="vertical-align: -0.0px; margin: -3px -3px -3px -3px;" src="pict.png" alt="image" width="609.4101074218751" height="560.45"/></p></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><p class="Centertext"><span class="Legend"><span class="FigureTarget"><a name="(counter._(figure._fig~3apc))" x-target-lift="Figure"></a>Figure&nbsp;1: </span>A core programming curriculum</span></p></blockquote><h5 class="heading"><a name="(part._sec~3acontext)"></a>The Context, for the Instructor<span class="button-group"><a href="#(part._sec~3acontext)" class="heading-anchor" title="Link to here">ðŸ”—</a><span style="visibility: hidden"> </span></span></h5><p>At my current institution, the course sits atop three programming courses. See
<a href="#%28counter._%28figure._fig~3apc%29%29" data-pltdoc="x">figure&nbsp;<span class="FigureRef">1</span></a> for a dependency diagram. The first course,
<span class="emph">Fundamentals I</span>, introduces students to the idea that good programming
calls for a systematic approach, starting with a careful analysis and
description of the relevant sets of data all the way to the creation of a unit
test suite.  It does not use an existing, &ldquo;industrial strength&rdquo; programming
language but several languages specifically designed for this audience of
novices and an approach that insists on systematic programming. Even though
the systematic design idea is about type-driven programming, these teaching
languages lack a type system, because a large majority of students end up at
co-op and internship positions where they use untyped languages. It is therefore
imperative to expose students to the mental discipline of using types for
program design even in the absence of a type checker.</p><p><span class="emph">Fundamentals II</span> injects two ideas into the curriculum: type checking and
object-oriented programming. The goal is to demonstrate that the principles of
systematic program design from <span class="emph">Fundamentals I</span> apply in the context of a
commercially successful language, Java.  The programming assignment and the
recurring programming project are still quite small.</p><p><span class="emph">Fundamentals III</span> scales up the ideas to projects with graphical views,
complex controls, and interesting models. The course begins to emphasize the
proper design of interfaces and programming to interfaces&#8212;<wbr></wbr>all in Java. The
course also illustrates the role of logical assertions in interfaces and in code
to supplement types, which almost never suffice to describe the true interface
of a class. This step points back to the (optional) course on <span class="emph">Logic</span>,
where students learn to formulate assertions about code as code. If the pace
permits it, an instructor of Fundamentals III may also conduct private code
inspections with students at the end of a project.</p><p><span class="emph">Socially Responsible Software Development</span>, short: <span class="emph">SRSD</span> and also
known as <span class="emph">Fundamentals IV</span>, is the source of the material in this book. It
<span class="refelem"><span class="refcolumn"><span class="refcontent"><a href="https://felleisen.org/srsd/Notes#choosing-a-language">Choosing a Language</a></span></span></span>
is the last course where instructors and teaching assistants inspect students&rsquo;
code in depth. Students get to pick their favorite language and IDE, partly so
that they can focus on program design and partly so that they can assess how
good they are in the language ecosystem of their choice.</p><p>Most importantly, the course is much more about the non-technical aspects of
programming-as-thinking than the first three; it is about the social
interactions that foster responsible thinking.  While students program in pairs
in the first three courses, they do so with some instruction but without much
supervision.  <span class="emph">SRSD</span> spends a large amount of time on the social aspect of
programming-thinking. Students program in pairs, present their work to their
peers on a regular basis, and critique each other extensively.  To reduce the
negativity, the instructor must teach that one doesn&rsquo;t criticize the creator of
code but only the code.</p><p>Practicing social software development in a classroom setting is challenging. I
have spent over two decades teaching and refining these pedagogic ideas. Quite a
few of them failed. This book collects the successful ones.</p><h5 class="heading"><a name="(part._this)"></a>This Book and Its Parts<span class="button-group"><a href="#(part._this)" class="heading-anchor" title="Link to here">ðŸ”—</a><span style="visibility: hidden"> </span></span></h5><p>The book consists of five chapters plus a postlude, following this prelude. The
different lengths of these chapters do not indicate differences in importance.</p><p>Chapter I spells out the most basic truth about software projects: most of them die
a rapid death. Yes, it is normal for projects to die. What matters are the
survivors.  When software survives, it survives for decades&#8212;<wbr></wbr>growing, adapting,
improving.  It is this longevity of software that demands socially responsible
behavior of developers to, and for, each other.</p><p>Chapter II describes the psychology and sociology of software development.
Developers are creators and artisans. Like all other artsy creators, they tend
to invest their ego into their creations, which is good because it means they
strive for excellence. But, by identifying with their creations, they also tend
to consider criticism of their creations as criticisms of their ego. Hence the
goal is to develop a healthy balance&#8212;<wbr></wbr>a compromise&#8212;<wbr></wbr>between pride in one&rsquo;s
software and an understanding of criticism as an attempt to make this product
even better.  Techniques for learning to critique and to embrace critique are
critical so that developers come to terms with this compromise. To this end,
instructors must create and yet dampen tensions between developers who present
their creation and peers who critique it. The tension is needed to train
socially responsible developers who stand up for current and future colleagues,
even if only because it could be them.</p><p>Chapter III explains how a software system comes about, how to build one, and how
to think about their maintainers at this stage already. Unlike the
<span class="emph">programs</span> students write in the first few courses, a <span class="emph">software
system</span> consists of many components (packages, modules, frameworks). When a team
follows a somewhat traditional development paths, it may create documents that
describe the components, the dependencies among them, the construction plans,
and the interfaces. Even if the team employs an &ldquo;agile&rdquo; or &ldquo;extreme coding&rdquo;
approach, sooner or later the need for these documents arises.  And these
non-code pieces exist so that, in the future, developers can easily and quickly
navigate the code base, distinguish task-relevant from irrelevant pieces, and
properly use components via interfaces. The way to get this right is to have
students try, have basics checked, fail, try again, and so on, every week of the
course.</p><p>Chapter IV .. components .. interfaces ..</p><p>Chapter V is about the programming skills it takes to build and maintain a
software system in a socially responsible manner. Conversely, ii is about the
basics of what reviewers should look out for when they inspect code.  While
students at this stage are expected to have a basic grasp of programming, this
book aims to make code development <span class="emph">systematic</span> even under pressure so that
the resulting code expresses the reasoning behind itself clearly.  Here
&ldquo;systematic&rdquo; ranges from small things&#8212;<wbr></wbr>naming&#8212;<wbr></wbr>and small pieces of code
(say, 10 lines) over modules and classes to full-sized semester projects (say,
10-20Kloc).  The key is to maintain this thoughtful, systematic approach under
time pressure, something that most developers suffer from. Without practicing
this form of development extensively&#8212;<wbr></wbr>in bootcamp fashion&#8212;<wbr></wbr>it is all to easy
to slip and write code so that &ldquo;it works,&rdquo; which we all know is the shortest
lie in computing. It works neither in the sense of functioning properly nor as a
well-formed message to the future.</p><p>The postlude draws a parallel between software development and life, and vice versa.
Doing things with the future&#8212;<wbr></wbr>short or long term&#8212;<wbr></wbr>in mind isn&rsquo;t just good for
software development, it is good for many different aspects of life. Then again,
thinking about the cycle of life during software development is a good idea, too.</p><h5 class="heading"><a name="(part._dear)"></a>Dear Instructor:<span class="button-group"><a href="#(part._dear)" class="heading-anchor" title="Link to here">ðŸ”—</a><span style="visibility: hidden"> </span></span></h5><p><span style="font-weight: bold">Note</span> QR symbols in the margins of the book point to supplementary notes
