Presenters face a panel of students (two plus one secretary).
2. All five get grades based on a set of questions about their performance. The sec is special.
3. The grades are ok, ok+, ok-, and zero.
4. The section TA take notes and the grades are based on our reconstruction of the code walks.
        We never try to compare students with each other.
5. In the end the students __vote__ on the meaning of these four grades (they submit for decreaing naturals in [0,100] and we average. Ill-formed votes.
        This acknowledges the partial subjectivity of the grading process. Students abuse the vote a bit so I keep the weight of this part below 40%.
6. Students with low grades (zero, ok-) are guaranteed to get a second chance, others don&#8217;t.
7. Final code walks are a separate weight. We grade them on a numeric scale from 0 to 10, emphasizing 5, 6, 8, and 9.  It&#8217;s about 15%.
8. Correctness is another 15-20% or so. We ru test fests.
        Cintinoius integration is a no-go.
        But I do give them a small number of sample integration tests every week,
        I think you know how those work. It makes for a neat improvement of the project (integration tests vs unit test).
9. The final big grade component is TA feedback, which is 20-25% and is all about living up to basic sw criteria.
        When TAs grade, they are supposed to imagine they take over the code.
        Their feedback concerns
        &#8212; signatures (in untyped code), types in typed PLs
        &#8212; purpseo statements for functions/methods whose name doesn&#8217;t convey enough
        &#8212; interpretations/purpose statemnets of data definitions//type defs
        &#8212; &#8220;size&#8221; of functions/methods: either compose smaller ones or dedicate them toi a single task
        &#8212; &#8220;sufficient&#8221; unit tests
        &#8212; all of these have been practiced in 3 semester courses before they see me &#8212; and forgot :-)
10. I steadily increase the number of points that students can get from the TAs over the semester, starting from things as low as 40 to 300+.
        If you mess up at first, we reward you for learning.</p><p>&#8212;<wbr></wbr>&#8212;<wbr></wbr>&#8212;<wbr></wbr>&#8212;<wbr></wbr>&#8212;<wbr></wbr>&#8212;<wbr></wbr>&#8212;<wbr></wbr>&#8212;<wbr></wbr>&#8212;<wbr></wbr>&#8212;<wbr></wbr>&#8212;<wbr></wbr>&#8212;<wbr></wbr>&#8212;<wbr></wbr>&#8212;<wbr></wbr>&#8212;<wbr></wbr>&#8212;<wbr></wbr>&#8212;<wbr></wbr>&#8212;<wbr></wbr>&#8212;<wbr></wbr>&#8212;<wbr></wbr>&#8212;<wbr></wbr>&#8212;<wbr></wbr>&#8212;<wbr></wbr>&#8212;<wbr></wbr>&#8212;<wbr></wbr>&ndash;</p><p>For 40 students only,, I had one PhD TA and two undergraduates occasionally 3.
For 120-140 students (last 3 years, every semester), I still have 1 PhD tTA (called a &#8220;technical TA&#8221;, sets up test fests) and around 10 ug/MS TAs.
        The feedback from TAs becomes more important as we go thru the
        semester.</p><p>&#8212;<wbr></wbr>&#8212;<wbr></wbr>&#8212;<wbr></wbr>&#8212;<wbr></wbr>&#8212;<wbr></wbr>&#8212;<wbr></wbr>&#8212;<wbr></wbr>&#8212;<wbr></wbr>&#8212;<wbr></wbr>&#8212;<wbr></wbr>&#8212;<wbr></wbr>&#8212;<wbr></wbr>&#8212;<wbr></wbr>&#8212;<wbr></wbr>&#8212;<wbr></wbr>&#8212;<wbr></wbr>&#8212;<wbr></wbr>&#8212;<wbr></wbr>&#8212;<wbr></wbr>&#8212;<wbr></wbr>&#8212;<wbr></wbr>&#8212;<wbr></wbr>&#8212;<wbr></wbr>&#8212;<wbr></wbr>&#8212;<wbr></wbr>&ndash;</p><p>At NEU we get one &#8220;TA&#8221; per 15 students, nominally. Depending on their status they can work 10-20 hours.</p><p>I like undergraduate TAs who have taken the course. But this works only if you are constantly on the lookout for non-seniors who can fill this role. You need to teach it every year, make sure to have non-seniors, people who are not on an off-coop cycle, and recruit before the course if over.</p><p>I have used mostly MS students who TA. I take them thru HtDP and HtDC to make sure they have an idea of what students should know in terms of program design.</p><p>if I can get people to TA twice, I make them &#8220;section TA&#8221; meaning they assist me in conducting code walks. They also lead a grading pod of 2 or 3 other TAs who &#8220;pair grade&#8221; the project milestones.</p><p>To reduce the grading load on TAs, I introduced a &#8220;self evaluation&#8221; check. Right after we harvest the current GIT status of projects, we push &#8220;self-eval&#8221; forms. These ask questions such as</p><p>&#8212; point us to the functionality for scoring the end state fo a game
        &#8212; since this task involves 3 clearly defined steps, point us to the 3 auxiliary methods/functions for those
        &#8212; tell us where the unit tests are for those</p><p>The students get 24 hours to push back answers to these questions, which are perma URLs to the relevant parts in github. These self-evals are checked for accuracy and get factored into the grade per milestone. No self-eval means, for example, we grade at the 60% level only.  This makes grading faster _and_ it pushes students to reflect on their failures. (It&#8217;s okay to answer a question with &#8220;oh, we didn&#8217;t factor out this function, which is why our main function is 100 lines long.)</p><p>There&#8217;s tons more to make this managable. &#8212; Matthias</p><div class="navsetbottom"><span class="navleft"><div class="nosearchform"></div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="tocsettoggle">&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="javascript:void(0);" title="show/hide table of contents" onclick="TocsetToggle();">contents</a></span></span><span class="navright">&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="index.html" title="backward to &quot;Notes on SRSD&quot;" data-pltdoc="x" rel="prev">&larr; prev</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="index.html" title="up to &quot;Notes on SRSD&quot;" data-pltdoc="x">up</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="note_not-teaching.html" title="forward to &quot;2 What Academia Cannot Teach&quot;" data-pltdoc="x" rel="next">next &rarr;</a></span>&nbsp;</div></div></div><div id="contextindicator">&nbsp;</div></body></html>
