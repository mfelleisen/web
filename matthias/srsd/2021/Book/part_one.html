Although the point of this slogan is that real software is hard to get really
right, the subtle message is that &ldquo;even if it works, you&rsquo;re not done yet.&rdquo;
Software systems once deployed need a lot of attention and a lot of additional
work. Software engineering researchers label this second phase
<span class="emph">maintenance</span>, and the word has acquired a negative connotation in the
developer community.</p><p>Maintenance is hard. People dislike maintaining software because they have to
read and comprehend old code, before they get to do anything. Sometimes this
reading-and-comprehending phase confronts them with the results of their own
inadequate programming skills from their early days on the job. Sometimes they
don&rsquo;t even know who created this &ldquo;awful&rdquo; code, and they just wish they could
rewrite it from scratch.</p><p>All of this brings us to the crux of the matter, namely, our perception of
software as &ldquo;something that works&rdquo; but also &ldquo;something that communicates
complex thoughts across long periods of time.&rdquo; From here it also becomes clear
that social responsibility really refers to how software developers should
relate to each other and to people they will never meet.</p><h3>1<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._ch~3alife)"></a>The Death of Software,
The Life of Software</h3><p>Most software dies an early death, without anyone ever laying eyes on it.</p><p>College majors in computer science know this fact well, too well. In most
courses with a programming component, they spend hours writing programs,
struggle to get them right, turn them in on time, and then get back the output
of an auto-grader. The professor certainly didn&rsquo;t look at their program; the
graders probably didn&rsquo;t. And when the task is done, the students won&rsquo;t ever look
at their code again.</p><p>Software developers have similar experiences throughout their career. Someone
has a great idea for a new product or feature. The team toils day and night to
get it finished. And then some &ldquo;guy in a suit,&rdquo; also known as a manager, tells
them that the marketing department no longer believes in the idea. And then it&rsquo;s
all over.</p><p>Even after the launch of some software, chances are that it fails. It just
doesn&rsquo;t attract enough users. It doesn&rsquo;t make enough
money. It&rsquo;s a failure, so there is no need to keep it around and invest in its
maintenance.</p><p>But, when software survives, it is likely to survive for a very long time. In
all likelihood, it will survive its creator. Consider the simple example of a
credit card. <span class="refelem"><span class="refcolumn"><span class="refcontent">If you have never heard of these programming
languages, look them up to get an idea what they look like.</span></span></span>  Even though you
may pay for your latte with a mobile app that combines Objective C with HTML and
CSS, the transaction is still going to invoke some COBOL code from the 1960s. On
its way, it may trigger some JavaScript, run Java on the server, poke a C/C++
routine or even some old Pascal, and then landed on the old COBOL code base&#8212;<wbr></wbr>a
code base that is 50+ years old.</p><p>In the 1990s, when your parents first started paying for things on the web with
credit cards, the banks were panicking. Everyone knew that the year 2000 was
coming and that the COBOL developers in the 1960s and 1970s had never imagined
their software to be in service beyond 1999. They represented every date with
two digits per day, month, and year. But what does <span class="stt">11</span> mean in the real
world? 1911? 2011? <span class="refelem"><span class="refcolumn"><span class="refcontent">See <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/berkshire-hathaways-stock-price-is-too-much-for-computers-11620168548?st=2mp6per61uwzrlo&amp;reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink">this WSJ article</a> for
details.&#8212;<wbr></wbr>More generally, the data representation of amounts poses a problem
that most interviewees for developer positions flunked for decades. If it ever
comes up in your interviews, remember that no built-in data type is good
enough.</span></span></span>  And dates aren&rsquo;t the only one kinds of information that poses such
problems. In 2021, the stock price of Berkshire Hathaway reached $421,000, and
at that point, software developers got worried because the maximum stock price
their predecessors had ever considered was $429,496.7295.</p><p>So what is software?</p><p>Now that you have some context, surviving software systems are messages across
time&#8212;<wbr></wbr> months, years, decades&#8212;<wbr></wbr>from one software developer to
another. Initially, the message may go from one software developer to the same
one, just an older version. Of one team member may hand it over to another
member of the same team. As time goes by, the software may need less and less
attention. Everyone involved in its initial creation may move on. And yet, on
occasion, someone needs to take a look at it. And every so often, an entire team
may have to comb through all its details because the software needs a major
overhaul.</p><p>Why does software need attention?</p><p>During the &ldquo;birth phase&rdquo; of a software system, developers may focus
on adding features, fixing basic bugs, and making the user interface
convenient to customers.  After the launch, users may use the software
in unforeseen ways and discover problems; the user interface nay need
tune-ups for people with less exposure to modern software; some may
wish for an additional feature; or they may request a faster response
in scenarios that the original developers didn&rsquo;t consider. Even after
a product has been stable for a while, it is never truly
finished. Software is the most malleable material with which humanity
has built amazing artifacts, and we all&#8212;<wbr></wbr>users, managers,
developers&#8212;<wbr></wbr>think that because of this malleability, we can turn
software into something new and better at any point in time.</p><p>Of course, software users deserve the same attention to quality as the users of
grocery bags, bridges, coffee cups, or elevators. After all, our software ends
up mobile games, nuclear reactors, point-of-sales systems, X-ray machines, or
airplanes. Some of those systems are life-critical and some are irrelevant to
life but a constant source of amusement. So making software work properly and
well has to be another major concern for developers.</p><p>And this brings us to the point of this book. Software developers have
a constant obligation to act in a socially responsible manner, because
their product ultimately serves, and connects them to, people. This
insight must inform the entire development and maintenance process,
and it must shape a developer&rsquo;s and a team&rsquo;s attitude toward its work.</p><h3>2<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._ch~3asocially-responsible)"></a>Are You Socially Responsible?</h3><p>What is &ldquo;social responsibility?&rdquo;</p><p>One intepretation of &ldquo;social responsibility&rdquo; focuses on the users and their
satisfaction. Clearly, the pilots of a control system for a Boeing 737 want the
software to work <span class="emph">correctly</span>. By contrast, when you post a note on a social
network or consume what your so-called friends share, you might be less
concerned with correctness but more so with <span class="emph">privacy</span>. In both cases, the
<span class="emph">convenience</span> of the graphical user interface plays a large role.</p><p><a name="(counter._(exercise._ex~3auser-responsibility))"></a><span style="font-weight: bold">Exercise</span>&nbsp;1. Can you come up with other properties the
software should have from the perspective of a user? For example, we could
weaken &ldquo;correct&rdquo; to &ldquo;fail-safe,&rdquo; which means &ldquo;the computation should never
perform any harmful actions.&rdquo; <a href="#%28counter._%28exercise._ex~3auser-responsibility%29%29" class="ex-end" data-pltdoc="x"></a></p><p>Although there is no denying the importance of this form of social
responsibility, software developers rarely get involved with these concerns
about users. In many companies, managers develop functionality criteria, perhaps
in conjunction with customer-users but without much input from developers. The
marketing guys may make promises about how safe user data is, and developers
have to live up to those. Finally, companies also often employ people who study
the interactions between users and the software, and then they turn those
studies into feedback for developer teams. The point is, social responsibility
to users is always expressed in terms of specifications that developers simply
must embrace.</p><blockquote class="SCentered"><p>&#8212;<wbr></wbr>&#8212;<wbr></wbr>&#8212;<wbr></wbr>&#8212;<wbr></wbr>&#8212;<wbr></wbr>&#8212;<wbr></wbr>&#8212;<wbr></wbr>&#8212;<wbr></wbr>&#8212;<wbr></wbr>&#8212;<wbr></wbr>&#8212;<wbr></wbr>&#8212;<wbr></wbr>&#8212;<wbr></wbr>&#8212;<wbr></wbr>&#8212;<wbr></wbr>&#8212;<wbr></wbr>&#8212;<wbr></wbr>&#8212;<wbr></wbr>&#8212;<wbr></wbr>&#8212;<wbr></wbr>&#8212;<wbr></wbr>&#8212;<wbr></wbr></p></blockquote><p>The other interpretation&#8212;<wbr></wbr>the one relevant for budding programmers because they
must internalize it&#8212;<wbr></wbr>concerns a developer&rsquo;s responsibility to other developers.
At this point, everyone will want to respond with a resounding &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to the
titular question.  Most of you might think &ldquo;socially responsible&rdquo; means being
nice to a pair programming partner and getting along with the team. But that&rsquo;s
easy. You see those people every day, they see you, and a violation of a social
protocol has immediate, unpleasant repercussions. But, in the software business
&ldquo;being nice&rdquo; to teammates isn&rsquo;t even remotely enough, partly because our
product connects us to many other developers and, in response, this idea must
influence the relationship to the other members in our team.</p><p>As the preceding section explains, software developers constantly communicate
with people whom they have never met; people whom they may never meet; and some
of whom will be born years after they retire. Yet, these people will suffer from
their creations, and they will inflict their pain on their spouses and
children. So, true social responsibility includes caring about these people,
too, and thinking along those lines affects our daily work.</p><p>The goal of these notes is to make you aware of these forms of responsibility,
both in terms of working with others and working on software. The expectation is
that this training prepares you to understand the immensely difficult trade-off
involved in developing software. It may mean being a little bit &ldquo;less nice&rdquo; to
people you meet on a daily basis and to trade their welfare for the welfare of
an uncountable number of others. This trade-off isn&rsquo;t easy, because we all
prefer to be &ldquo;nice&rdquo; and to &ldquo;get along.&rdquo; Practice will help you master this
trade-off.</p><p>Now, let&rsquo;s get started.</p><div class="navsetbottom"><span class="navleft"><div class="nosearchform"></div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="navright">&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="part_preface.html" title="backward to &quot;Prelude&quot;" data-pltdoc="x">&larr; prev</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="index.html" title="up to &quot;Socially Responsible  Software Development&quot;" data-pltdoc="x">up</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="part_two.html" title="forward to &quot;II Principles&quot;" data-pltdoc="x">next &rarr;</a></span>&nbsp;</div></div></div><div id="contextindicator">&nbsp;</div></body></html>
