extremely intensive course on general programming. In this course, students
typically work on a large-ish project with several deadlines, develop tons of
code, and learn to collaborate with each other. Rarely, though, are the learning
goals stated explicitly, plus the intense focus on programming obscures what a
university course can, and should, contribute to the programming education at
this stage of a student&rsquo;s education.</p><p><div class="SIntrapara">This book provides an organization for such a course. Its central premises are

See
<a href="#%28counter._%28figure._fig~3apc%29%29" data-pltdoc="x">figure&nbsp;<span class="FigureRef">1</span></a> for a diagram of the core programming curriculum. The first
course, <span class="emph">Fundamentals I</span>, introduces students to the idea that good
programming calls for a systematic approach, starting with a careful analysis
and description of the relevant sets of data all the way to the creation of a
unit test suite.  It does not use an existing, &ldquo;industrial strength&rdquo;
programming language but several languages specifically designed for this
audience of novices and the systematic-programming curriculum. These teaching
languages lack a type system&#8212;<wbr></wbr>even though the design is type-driven&#8212;<wbr></wbr>because
a large majority of students end up at co-op and internship positions where they
use a similar language. I consider it therefore imperative to expose students to
the mental discipline of using types for program design even in the absence of a
type checker.</p><p><span class="refelem"><span class="refcolumn"><span class="refcontent">Students and graduates report that Java is the largest
programming languages, but it occupies only a minority market share.</span></span></span>
<span class="emph">Fundamentals II</span> injects two ideas into the curriculum: type checking and
explicit, object-oriented programming. The goal is to demonstrate that the
principles of systematic program design from <span class="emph">Fundamentals I</span> apply in the
context of a commercially successful language, Java.  But, the programming assignment
and the recurring programming project are still quite small.</p><p><span class="emph">Fundamentals III</span> scales up the ideas to projects with graphical views,
complex controls, and interesting models. The course begins to emphasize the
proper design of interfaces and programming to interfaces&#8212;<wbr></wbr>all in Java.  For
students who have taken the (now optional) <span class="emph">Logic</span> course, the course also
illustrates the role of logical assertions in interfaces and in code.</p><p><span class="emph">Socially Responsible Software Development</span>, short: <span class="emph">SRSD</span> and also
known as <span class="emph">Fundamentals IV</span>, is the source of the material in this book. It
is the last course where instructors and teaching assistants inspect the code
that students deliver in depth.  To make students feel comfortable, they get to
pick their favorite one, because at this point in their development they have
seen several and have formed an opinion.
<span class="refelem"><span class="refcolumn"><span class="refcontent">As the diagram in <a href="#%28counter._%28figure._fig~3apc%29%29" data-pltdoc="x">figure&nbsp;<span class="FigureRef">1</span></a> indicates, students take
courses from many different areas for the remaining two years: Software Engineering, Formal Methods, Programming Languages, Artificial Intelligence, etc..</span></span></span></p><p>Most importantly, the course is much more about the non-technical aspects of
thinking-programming; it is about the social interactions that foster good
thinking.  While students program in pairs for some time in the first three
courses, <span class="emph">SRSD</span> spends a large amount of time on the social aspect
of programming-thinking. Students program in pairs, present their work to their
peers on a regular basis, and critique each others creations extensively.</p><p>Practicing social responsibility and systematic design plus combining those
ideas in one context is challenging. I have spent over two decades teaching and
refining my approaches. Many of my ideas failed; this book collects the
successful ones.</p><h5><a name="(part._skills)"></a>Developing a Mind Set</h5><p><div class="SIntrapara">The goal is to develop a mind set about software development that focuses on two
imperatives:
</div><div class="SIntrapara"><ul><li><p>develop software in a systematic fashion, and</p></li><li><p>develop software with, <span class="emph">and for</span>, other developers.</p></li></ul></div><div class="SIntrapara">The second bullet includes people that the current software developers haven&rsquo;t
met yet and may never meet. And that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s proper to call it &ldquo;socially
responsible software development.&rdquo;</div></p><p>Unsurprisingly the two imperatives are intertwined. Systematic software
development means a lot of hard thinking, which happens in the developer&rsquo;s
mind. No software tools in even the best interactive development environments
check the thinking of a developer.  They can&rsquo;t. It takes another developer&#8212;<wbr></wbr>at
least one other developer&#8212;<wbr></wbr>to make sure the thinking behind code is on the
right track and it is expressed in a systematic way in code. At the same time,
when a developer is tasked with fixing a bug in old code or add a feature to
code from yesteryear, it takes time to read and comprehend the code. Although
software tools can again assist with the mechanics of the task, truth is that
systematically developed and properly presented code signals clearly what the
creator thought and what is needed to make changes.</p><p>One way to instill this mindset is to expose students and practitioners to all
aspects all the time&#8212;<wbr></wbr>and to provide continuous and intense feedback. For
example, while programming must happen in pairs, presentations assume that the
partner has left so that the audience can form a judgment about the proper pair
programming. The audience also plays the role of the future developers who takes
over a code base, asking penetrating questions about every aspect of systematic
design. Without an exception, such interactions can lead to unhappy
conversations&#8212;<wbr></wbr>but they are for the benefit of the future maintainer of the
code, who may be one of the reviewers or not be born yet. Being socially
responsible in just our professions is hard. Practice makes perfect, but an
instructor&rsquo;s job is to make sure that the practice is done right.</p><h5><a name="(part._this)"></a>This Book and Its Parts</h5><p>The book consists of three parts. Part I spells out the life cycle of a typical
software project: the normal, premature death and the life of survivor projects.
It is the later that points to the tremendous social responsibilities of
developers.</p><p>Part II describes the psychology and sociology of software development.
Developers are creators. Like all other artsy creators tend to identify with
their creations and criticism of their creations with criticisms of their ego.
Unless developers properly understand this relationship, their interactions with
their social context may become contentious. Then again, some tension and some
friction are natural in this context, because socially responsible developers
must stand up for colleagues whom they have not met yet and may never meet.</p><p>Part III concerns technical skills. While readers of the book are expected to
have some basic grasp of programming, this book aims to make programming
<span class="emph">systematic</span>, for both small snippets and semester-size projects. Given
enough time, everyone can create small pieces of code&#8212;<wbr></wbr>a class, a method, a
function&#8212;<wbr></wbr>systematically. The key is to scale this skill to sizable projects,
that is, projects that consist of dozens of modules, classes, functions, and
files. This step&#8212;<wbr></wbr>from individual methods or classes to nests of interconnected
modules&#8212;<wbr></wbr>is difficult because it injects time pressure and assumes that all
small parts are still built properly, despite all the pressure.</p><p>The text points to teaching notes in the margins at many places, like the one
above about what universities cannot, and should not, teach in depth. These
notes explain how to manage all these ideas in a course setting, from setting up
the project to dealing with in-person code reviews.</p><p><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="SVerbatim"><tr><td><p><span class="stt"></span><span class="hspace">&nbsp;</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><span class="stt">where do I put these ideas:</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><span class="stt"></span><span class="hspace">&nbsp;</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><span class="stt">-- some piecces of a project are outsourced;</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><span class="stt"></span><span class="hspace">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="stt">you may never meet these developers face-to-face</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><span class="stt"></span><span class="hspace">&nbsp;</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><span class="stt">-- what is the mental state of these developers?</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><span class="stt"></span><span class="hspace">&nbsp;</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><span class="stt">-- what is the mental state of programmers you work with?</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><span class="stt"></span><span class="hspace">&nbsp;</span></p></td></tr></table></p><div class="navsetbottom"><span class="navleft"><div class="nosearchform"></div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="navright">&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="index.html" title="backward to &quot;Socially Responsible  Software Development&quot;" data-pltdoc="x">&larr; prev</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="index.html" title="up to &quot;Socially Responsible  Software Development&quot;" data-pltdoc="x">up</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="part_one.html" title="forward to &quot;I Perspective&quot;" data-pltdoc="x">next &rarr;</a></span>&nbsp;</div></div></div><div id="contextindicator">&nbsp;</div></body></html>
