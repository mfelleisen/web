Although the point of this slogan is that real software is hard to get really
right, the implicit message is that &ldquo;even if it works, you&rsquo;re not done yet.&rdquo;
Software systems once deployed need a lot of attention and a lot of additional
work. Software engineering researchers label this second phase
<span class="emph">maintenance</span>. For all kinds of reasons, this word has acquired a
negative connotation in the developer community. In the end, though, only
permanently maintained software is truly relevant and important.</p><p>Maintenance is hard. People dislike maintaining software because they have to
read and comprehend old code before they get to do anything. Sometimes this
reading-and-comprehending phase confronts them with the results of their own
inadequate programming skills from their early days on the job. Sometimes they
don&rsquo;t even know who created this code decades ago, and they just wish they
could rewrite it all from scratch.</p><p>All of this brings us to the crux of the matter, namely, our perception of
software as &ldquo;something that works&rdquo; but also &ldquo;something that communicates
complex thoughts across potentially long periods of time.&rdquo; From this
formulation, it also becomes clear that social responsibility has two sides: on
one hand there is the end-user of the software; on the other, we find the
software developers themselves and how they relate to each other. While both are
important, this book focuses on the second aspect, the software developers&rsquo;
responsibility to each other. But let&rsquo;s investigate the argument slowly and
carefully first.</p><h3>1<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._ch~3alife)"></a>The Death of Software,  The Life of Software</h3><p>Most software dies an early death, without anyone ever laying eyes on it.</p><p>College majors in computer science know this fact well, too well. In most
courses with a programming component, they spend hours writing programs,
struggle to get them right, turn them in on time, and then get back the output
of an auto-grading system. The professor certainly didn&rsquo;t look at their program;
the teaching assistants didn&rsquo;t. And when the task is done, the students won&rsquo;t
ever look at their code again.</p><p>Professional software developers have similar experiences throughout their
career. Someone has a great idea for a new product or feature. The team toils
day and night to get it finished. Until eventually some &ldquo;guy in a suit,&rdquo; also
known as a manager, tells them that the marketing department no longer believes
in the idea. And then it&rsquo;s all over.</p><p>Even after the launch of some software, chances are that it fails. It just
doesn&rsquo;t attract enough users. It doesn&rsquo;t make enough
money. It&rsquo;s a failure, so there is no need to keep it around and invest in its
maintenance.</p><p>When software survives, it is likely to survive for a very long time. In all
likelihood, it will survive its creator. Consider the simple example of a credit
card. <span class="refelem"><span class="refcolumn"><span class="refcontent">If you have never heard of these programming languages, look
them up. It&rsquo;s educational.</span></span></span>  Even though you may pay for your latte with a
mobile app that combines Objective C with HTML and CSS, the transaction is
probably going to invoke some COBOL or RPG code from the 1960s. On its way, it
may trigger some JavaScript scripts; run Java on the server; poke a C/C++
routine or even some old Pascal; and then land on the old COBOL code base&#8212;<wbr></wbr>a
code base that is 50+ years old.</p><p>In the 1990s, when your parents first started paying for things on the web with
credit cards, the banks were panicking. Everyone knew that the year 2000 was
coming and that the COBOL developers in the 1960s and 1970s had never imagined
their software to be in service beyond 1999. They represented every date with
two digits per day, month, and year. Memory was in scarce supply and therefore
expensive. But what does <span class="stt">11</span> mean in the real world? 1911? 2011? This choice
of representing dates as two-digit data became known as the &ldquo;Year 2000&rdquo;
problem.  <span class="refelem"><span class="refcolumn"><span class="refcontent">See <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/berkshire-hathaways-stock-price-is-too-much-for-computers-11620168548?st=2mp6per61uwzrlo&amp;reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink">this WSJ article</a>
for details.&#8212;<wbr></wbr>More generally, the data representation of amounts poses a
problem that most interviewees for developer positions flunked for decades. If
it ever comes up in your interviews, remember that no built-in data type is good
enough.</span></span></span></p><p>Dates aren&rsquo;t the only one form of information that poses such problems. In 2021,
the stock price of Berkshire Hathaway reached $421,000, and at that point,
software developers got worried because the maximum stock price their
predecessors had ever considered was $429,496.7295. Indeed, there are many other
systemic glitches that made it into software systems and that some developers
eventually had to fix. And the problem never disappears, So imagine yourself be
tasked with reading such badly aged software and spending just enough effort to
eliminate such problems&#8212;<wbr></wbr>because your company&rsquo;s well-being and your high salary
depend on it.</p><p>So what is software?</p><p>Surviving software systems are messages across time&#8212;<wbr></wbr>years, decades&#8212;<wbr></wbr>from one
software developer to another. Initially, the message may go from one software
developer to the same one, just an older version. Or one team member may hand it
over to another member of the team. As time goes by, the software may need less
and less attention. Everyone involved in its initial creation may move on. Yet,
on occasion, someone needs to take a look at it. And every so often, an entire
team may have to comb through all its details because the software needs a major
overhaul.</p><p>Why does software need attention?</p><p>During the &ldquo;birth phase&rdquo; of a software system, developers may focus on adding
features, fixing basic bugs, and making the user interface convenient for
customers.  After the launch, customers may use the software in unforeseen ways
and discover problems; the user interface may need tune-ups for people with less
exposure to modern software; some may wish for an additional feature; or they
may request a fast response in scenarios that the original developers didn&rsquo;t
anticipate. Even after a product has been stable for a while, it is never truly
finished. Software is the most malleable material with which humanity has built
amazing artifacts, and we all&#8212;<wbr></wbr>users, managers, developers&#8212;<wbr></wbr>think that because
of this malleability, we can turn software into something new and better at any
point in time.</p><p>In summary, a survivor software system is a continuously evolving product. At
different points in time, the evolution speeds up or slows down. But the system
evolves. Evolution means changes, and changes affect both end-users and the
system&rsquo;s developers. The burden on the latter is immense: they must ensure that
end-users are safe and secure, all while helping future developers understand
how the product functions. In other words, software developers have an
obligation to be responsible for others&#8212;<wbr></wbr>an obligation of social
responsibility.</p><h3>2<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._ch~3asocially-responsible)"></a>Are You Socially Responsible?</h3><p>What is social responsibility?</p><p>One intepretation of &ldquo;social responsibility&rdquo; focuses on the users and their
satisfaction. End-users of software deserve (at least) the same quality service
as the users of grocery bags, bridges, coffee cups, elevators, and so on.  After
all, our software ends up in mobile games, nuclear reactors, point-of-sales
systems, X-ray machines, or airplanes. Some of those systems are life-critical;
some are irrelevant to life but a good source of amusement.</p><p>Think of the pilots of a Boeing 737; they want the control software to work
<span class="emph">correctly</span>. Consider &ldquo;friends&rdquo; on social media; they might be less
concerned with correctness than <span class="emph">privacy</span>. In both cases, the
<span class="emph">convenience</span> of the graphical user interface plays a large role.  So
making software work properly and well is a many-faceted problem, and it
definitely connects developers to other people&#8212;<wbr></wbr>end-users as they are called
here.</p><p><a name="(counter._(exercise._ex~3auser-responsibility))"></a><span style="font-weight: bold">Exercise</span>&nbsp;1. Can you think of other properties an
end-user may expect from software? For example, we could weaken &ldquo;correct&rdquo; to
&ldquo;fail-safe,&rdquo; which means &ldquo;the code should never perform any harmful
actions.&rdquo;<a href="#%28counter._%28exercise._ex~3auser-responsibility%29%29" class="ex-end" data-pltdoc="x"></a></p><p>Although there is no denying the importance of this form of social
responsibility, software developers rarely get involved with these concerns
about users. In many companies, managers develop functionality criteria, perhaps
in conjunction with customer and/or user representatives but usually without
much input from developers. The marketing guys may make promises about how safe
user data is, and developers have to live up to those as well as they
can. Finally, companies also often employ people who study the interactions
between users and the software, and these people then turn those studies into
feedback for developer teams. The point is, social responsibility to users is
always expressed in terms of specifications that software developers must simply
accept.</p><p><div class="SIntrapara">Which brings us to a first critical point:
</div><div class="SIntrapara"><blockquote><p> While software developers bear responsibility for their
product&rsquo;s interactions with end-users, software developers are usually insulated
from end-users and the people in-between must accept a larger degree of
responsibility.</p></blockquote></div></p><p>The other interpretation of the phrase concerns the developer&rsquo;s responsibility
to other developers. If developers are somewhat insulated from end-users, they
are closely connected to their teammates. A common (good!) practice is to rotate
pieces of a common code base among the members of a team, meaning one close
colleague receives code from another. Consider the reaction of the second if the
code from the first is difficult or impossible to understand. &ldquo;This colleague
just robbed me of hours of my time, my evening with my wife/boyfriend/son with
this bad code.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s the best reaction to expect. Even if a team doesn&rsquo;t
rotate responsibilities, a new colleague may encounter this reaction. Or, months
and years later, a maintainer newly assigned to this old code may get a shock
looking at it&#8212;<wbr></wbr>and chase down the original creator to share some thoughts.</p><p><div class="SIntrapara">Having said that, we can now articulate the second insight:
</div><div class="SIntrapara"><blockquote><p>Software developers are responsible to each other. Only
socially responsible software development will save colleagues&#8212;<wbr></wbr>near and far,
in time and location&#8212;<wbr></wbr>time and energy to decipher the thinking that the code
expresses.</p></blockquote></div><div class="SIntrapara">In other words, this second interpretation is the relevant one for budding
programmers. After all, they must internalize this interpretation before they
become productive team members.</div></p><p><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><p>&#160;</p></td></tr><tr><td><p></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>&#160;</p></td></tr></table></p><p>At this point, everyone will want to respond with a resounding &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to the
titular question.  Most of you might think &ldquo;socially responsible&rdquo; means being
nice to a pair programming partner and getting along with the team. But that&rsquo;s
easy. You see those people every day, they see you, and a violation of a social
protocol has immediate, unpleasant repercussions. In the software business
&ldquo;being nice&rdquo; to teammates isn&rsquo;t even remotely enough; indeed, it might be
counter-productive.</p><p>True social responsibility includes caring about the people who take on the
team&rsquo;s code base down the line, whether we know them or not. For the sake of
these future colleagues, it is necessary&#8212;<wbr></wbr>socially resonsible&#8212;<wbr></wbr>to critique our
immediate colleagues and to ask them to critique our work. This mutual
critiquing must substitute for the reaction maintainers will have when they take
on our code base, in a year or ten years from now.</p><p>The goal of this book is to make you aware of this form of responsibility, both
in terms of working with others and working on software. The expectation is that
this training prepares you to understand the immensely difficult trade-off
involved in developing software. It may mean being a little bit &ldquo;less nice&rdquo; to
people you meet on a daily basis and to trade their feelings for the welfare of
yourself (taking over their code in a few weeks); for the welfare of other team
members; and for an uncountable number of others in the future. This trade-off
isn&rsquo;t easy, because we all prefer to be &ldquo;nice&rdquo; and to &ldquo;get along.&rdquo; Getting
this trade-off right requires following basic development and interaction
techniques. Practicing these techniques on a daily basis turns them into second
nature, which makes them useful&#8212;<wbr></wbr>and easily acceptable&#8212;<wbr></wbr>in the long run.</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold">Reading</span></p><p>Kent Beck. <span style="font-style: italic">Extreme Programming Explained.</span> Addison-Wesley. 1999.&#8212;<wbr></wbr>In
this book, Beck repeatedly argues for eight-hour days, 40-hour weeks, vacation
time, and time for family.  His key argument is that a software developer needs
time to recover from thinking intensively. It is occasionally worth re-reading
such passages, such as the one near the end of   in his book.
Many software developers experience the opposite, however. They are confronted
with an impenetrable code base, without means of navigating it, without a
systematic approach. They spent endless hours understanding relationships that
the original creator had in mind and left undocumented; they spend nights
figuring out spaghetti code<span class="refelem"><span class="refcolumn"><span class="refcontent">Look up the term &ldquo;spaghetti code&rdquo;.</span></span></span>
and the thinking behind it, which again, the original creator had a chance to
express clearly. All these hours could be spend on a spouse, children, a
vacation, hobbies, etc. From this perspective, the original creator is a
&ldquo;thief,&rdquo; a person who steals these hours from the maintainer.</p><div class="navsetbottom"><span class="navleft"><div class="nosearchform"></div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="tocsettoggle">&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="javascript:void(0);" title="show/hide table of contents" onclick="TocsetToggle();">contents</a></span></span><span class="navright">&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="part_preface.html" title="backward to &quot;Prelude&quot;" data-pltdoc="x">&larr; prev</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="index.html" title="up to &quot;Socially Responsible  Software Development&quot;" data-pltdoc="x">up</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="part_two.html" title="forward to &quot;II Principles&quot;" data-pltdoc="x">next &rarr;</a></span>&nbsp;</div></div></div><div id="contextindicator">&nbsp;</div></body></html>
