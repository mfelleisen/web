the <a href="abstract.html" data-pltdoc="x">Abstract</a> explains the course has two goals. This page describes the
mechanics for achieving these goals.</p><p><span style="color: blue">Process</span> I will present two themes (see <a href="lectures.html" data-pltdoc="x">Lectures</a>) in the first
couple of weeks so that you get an idea of what a theme is and how to present
it.</p><p><div class="SIntrapara">During this time, you will pick and prepare two or three <a href="themes.html" data-pltdoc="x">Themes</a>:
</div><div class="SIntrapara"><ol><li><p>PhD students propose three <a href="themes.html" data-pltdoc="x">Themes</a> of interest, each supported by at
least one central citation. Everyone else propose two <a href="themes.html" data-pltdoc="x">Themes</a>. Send
email with the theme proposals plus time slots when you are available for a
meeting.</p><p><span style="color: purple">Due date</span> Meet by the beginning of the second class meeting. You may set up a
meeting as soon as you read this page.</p></li><li><p>Once a theme is approved, compile a list of up to ten major (but
no fewer than three) articles on this theme. <span class="emph">Read</span> the
introductory part of each article so that you can explain its role in
the evolution of the theme.</p><p>Submit a list of references to the instructor. Each reference should consist of
the author(s), the title, a PDF link, and a sentence or two that explains your
understanding of the role of the paper.</p><p>If you are new to the idea of exploring themes, discuss how to go about this
step during your first 1-1 meeting with the instructor.</p><p><span style="color: purple">Due date</span> by the third class meeting.</p></li><li><p>Set up a meeting with the instructor to discuss the proposed sequence of
articles. This meeting will decide which articles to use.</p><p><span style="color: purple">Due date</span> between the third and fourth class meeting.</p></li><li><p><span class="emph">Write</span> a short abstract, like those in <a href="lectures.html" data-pltdoc="x">Lectures</a>,
that explains the very basic steps of your theme&rsquo;s evolution&#8212;<wbr></wbr>as
represented by the chosen papers.</p><p><span style="color: purple">Due date</span> as soon as possible after the selection meeting and before
the presentation to the class.</p></li><li><p><span class="emph">Study</span> the selected papers. Prepare an annotated bibliography of the
chosen articles. Prepare a blackboard/whiteboard presentation.</p><p><span style="color: purple">Due date</span> please have a draft of your presentation ready a week before your
presentation. Then meet with the instructor if there are any questions on how to
present the material. That way we can make changes in a timely fashion.</p></li></ol></div><div class="SIntrapara">The schedule for the first round of themes will be set up after the third class
meeting.  Everyone will present a first theme before PhD students
present a second one. The schedule for the second round is subject to
enrollment and scheduling constraints.</div></p><p><span style="color: blue">Presentations</span> Ordinarily you would deliver a blackboard/whiteboard
presentation.</p><p><span class="refelem"><span class="refcolumn"><span class="refcontent">If you can think of a better simulation of bb/wb lectures, let me
know.</span></span></span>  This semester you will hand-write your presentation on a notepad (yes,
paper and pencil!), scan the pages with your phone, and use those scans for the
lecture.  If you have a document camera or an electronic notebook that can
deliver live writing, you may wish to use those and write as you speak.</p><p>Why?</p><p>The focus of this seminar is on ideas, not details. A slideshow makes it too
easy to include silly proof details, superfluous benchmark measurements, or some
random "people counting" tables. This form of copying-and-pasting material from
a paper to a slideshow tool does not demonstrate understanding. Turning it into
essential words for a blackboard presentation does.</p><p>Why?</p><p>Many PhD students want to become professors and that job includes teaching.
Learning to separate essential ideas from chaff is critical to teaching.
Learning to arrange material for a lecture and deliver it "freely" is
critical. Learning to adapt a presentation schedule on the fly&#8212;<wbr></wbr>go deep, pull
back, cut&#8212;<wbr></wbr>is something every professor must do during almost every lecture.</p><p>Software developers often argue language and process details. In such one-on-one
or small-group discussions they teach. Having lectured before, helps you think
through chains of arguments, starting with the &ldquo;big&rdquo; idea and slowly refining
it to the details as needed&#8212;<wbr></wbr>and no more.</p><p><span style="color: blue">Listening</span> If you are not presenting, you will assess the lecture of your
presenting peer and submit your <a href="form.html" data-pltdoc="x">Assessment</a> to the instructor. Your
assessments will provide feedback concerning both the content and the
presentation.</p><p>Why?</p><p>Writing an assessment forces you to pay close attention. Reflecting on what you
have seen and what you have heard will help you figure out how <span class="emph">your own</span>
presentations can be improved.</p><div class="navsetbottom"><span class="navleft"><div class="nosearchform"></div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="navright">&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="abstract.html" title="backward to &quot;Abstract&quot;" data-pltdoc="x">&larr; prev</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="index.html" title="up to &quot;History of Programming Languages&quot;" data-pltdoc="x">up</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="themes.html" title="forward to &quot;Themes&quot;" data-pltdoc="x">next &rarr;</a></span>&nbsp;</div></div></div><div id="contextindicator">&nbsp;</div></body></html>
