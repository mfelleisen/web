As the <a href="abstract.html" data-pltdoc="x">Abstract</a> explains the course has two goals. This page describes
the seminar workings and the process of how to reach this goal.</p><p><span style="color: blue">Process</span> I will present some themes in the first couple of weeks so that
students get an idea of what a theme is and how to present it.</p><p><div class="SIntrapara">During this time, students will pick and prepare their first round of
<a href="themes.html" data-pltdoc="x">Themes</a>:
</div><div class="SIntrapara"><ol><li><p>Propose two <a href="themes.html" data-pltdoc="x">Themes</a> of interest, supported by at least one
critical citation.</p><p>Due date: second class meeting.</p></li><li><p>Set up a brief meeting with the instructor to pick a theme distinct from
what all other students have picked.</p><p>Due date: between the second and third class meeting.</p></li><li><p>Once a theme is approved, students compile a list of up to ten major (but
no fewer than three) articles on this theme and submit them as a plain list of
references&#8212;<wbr></wbr>with links to PDFs&#8212;<wbr></wbr>to the instructor.  Students should at least
<span class="emph">read</span> the introductory part of each article so that they can explain its
role in the evolution of a theme.</p><p>Students new to the idea of exploring themes should discuss how to go about this
step during their first 1-1 meeting with the instructor.</p><p>Due date: fourth class meeting.</p></li><li><p>Set up a meeting with the instructor to discuss the proposed sequence of
articles. This meeting will decide which articles to use.</p><p>Due date: between the fourth and fifth class meeting.</p></li><li><p><span class="emph">Study</span> the selected papers. Prepare an annotated bibliography of the
chosen articles. Prepare a blackboard/whiteboard presentation.</p><p>Due date: the schedule will be set up after the fifth class meeting. In all
likelihood, students will be scheduled to present themes as of the seventh class
meeting.</p></li></ol></div><div class="SIntrapara">The schedule for the second round is subject to enrollment and
scheduling constraints. I will publish it as soon as the schedule for the first
round firms up.</div></p><p><span style="color: blue">Presentations</span> Students will deliver a blackboard/whiteboard
presentation.</p><p>Why?</p><p>The focus of this seminar is on ideas, not details. A slideshow makes it too
easy to include silly proof details, superfluous benchmark measurements, or some
random "people counting" tables. This form of copying and pasting material from
a paper to a slideshow tool does not demonstrate understanding. Turning it into
essential words for a blackboard presentation does.</p><p>Why?</p><p>Many PhD students want to become professors and that job includes teaching.
Learning to separate essential ideas from chaff is critical to teaching.
Learning to arrange material for a lecture and deliver it "freely" is
critical. Learning to adapt a presentation schedule on the fly&#8212;<wbr></wbr>go deep, pull
back, cut&#8212;<wbr></wbr>is something every professor must do during almost every lecture.</p><p><span style="color: blue">Listening</span> Students in the audience will assess the lecture and submit
their assessment to the instructor. These assessments will focus on the content
and the presentation. I will post a form outline in time for the first
presentations.  Students will use this outline to articulate their thoughts in
writing by the end of the day and submit this text file to the
instructor.&#8212;<wbr></wbr>This assessment is unrelated to grading.</p><div class="navsetbottom"><span class="navleft"><div class="nosearchform"></div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="navright">&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="abstract.html" title="backward to &quot;Abstract&quot;" data-pltdoc="x">&larr; prev</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="index.html" title="up to &quot;History of Programming Languages&quot;" data-pltdoc="x">up</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="themes.html" title="forward to &quot;Themes&quot;" data-pltdoc="x">next &rarr;</a></span>&nbsp;</div></div></div><div id="contextindicator">&nbsp;</div></body></html>
