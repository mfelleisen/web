<p>Tyranny over the little green men is not as difficult as would seem;
dictating the horde of scribblers is no great difficulty. Each one
responds with complete and utter obedience to every command; the
difficulty is in giving the correct demand. This art of accurately
commanding is the scheme programming that we do in class. There are many
key facets to this direction, which must be explained before
understanding the gravity of the power wielded, as well as what to be
frustrated with when your green men do not execute the program, as you
desire for them to.

<p>Vital to all aspects of programming is being specific. Checking syntax
at every corner and knowing the exact inputs and outputs of all
functions is a must to create a working program for the green men to
execute. A single letter out of place can hold a programmer back days in
searching for the error, therefore it is of utmost importance to pay
careful attention to each keystroke, and each definition. A draw-circle
instead of make-circle is a huge difference, which could result in a
traffic light that will not turn yellow. Small mistakes are compounded
exponentially in recursive functions, so the best dictators of green men
must always be very wary of such mistakes.

<p>The Design Recipe really facilitates the drafting process, mainly as a
thought organizer, like and outline. It clears up exactly what the
program does, what its inputs and outputs are, and even how the function
should look. Without the Design Recipe the process would be much more
difficult than it is now. Being a part of the Design Recipe, it should
be noted that the form of a function, the template, tends to drive it
along, which is what the template is for. Every time a function has
errors, at least in my experience, it has deviated from the original
template in some way, whereas if it did not deviate its probability of
success would shoot right up. Templates are specifically vague, their
form is specific but their content is vague. This allows like programs
to be developed much more easily, via the same template, once the
phenomena of similar functions having similar forms is recognized.

<p>A programmer must also know the different types of data inputs and
outputs could be. Structures, lists, strings, symbols, Booleans, and
numbers abound. It is quite possible, and likely, to have a list of
structures containing lists of structures containing symbols and
corresponding numbers. This nesting of data is another of the most
difficult aspects of the art. Pulling or putting data into these complex
lists and structures requires a keen eye for detail and organization; a
reasonable and systematic mind is required to unravel the name of the
man with the social security number equal to the ssn field of your
function in a list of structures.

<p>Apply these complex structures to recursive programs, which call upon
themselves again, or to mutually referential programs, which define each
other by each other, so one does not make sense without the other, or
visa versa, and the process becomes even more difficult. However, with
outputs and inputs clearly defined within a set shape, everything will
eventually go smoothly.

<p>The fact of the matter is that programming is a systematic process,
which requires a systematic mind. Every part of a program makes complete
sense, but finding such sense can be quite challenging for beings with
such a non-linear path of understanding as human beings. Constancy and
clarity are kings for commanding the green legions; with these traits
under ones belt a program will eventually start working. However, for
those less patient and systematic, the glory of epiphany to complete a
program is grand indeed, when the legions of green men line up and do
exactly what you bid them to do.
