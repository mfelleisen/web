<cite>How to Design Program, Second Edition</cite> is about to appear with
MIT Press. 

One of the original goals was to reduce the size of the book with the
elimination of the past two parts. Sadly we discovered too many interesting
application examples over the years and added too much text.  For the third
edition, we will separate the principles of design from some of the lengthy
project-level examples, which will remain available as linked, on-line
material. We really do wish to reduce the size of the print edition and
thus improve its affordability. 

In the process, we will also improve some of the design material, e.g., the
material on compositional and iterative design (in I and II), the material
on program design, some new material on debugging with the design recipe
and a few more smaller ideas.
