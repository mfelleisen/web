Hi -- 

thank you for agreeing to present one of your "themes" in my HoPL
seminar. It is time to put together a schedule for our presentations.

The seminar will take place on Tuesdays and Fridays, from 9:50am 
to 11:30am. It is currently scheduled for Snell 017. 

For now I have listed people in descending order of their "research age":

What I need from you right now is 

 (1) a theme and ideally URLs to the papers that go with your theme 
 (2) a signal if the chosen data does not work for you 

In case of overlapping classes, I will arrange an alternative time/place.

My Preferences: 

Just to re-iterate, my preference is a coherent series of three to five
papers spread over say five to ten years and the youngest paper in the
sequence ought to be at least five years old. If some of those papers
aren't yours, that's fine too. 

I expect students to deliver blackboard lectures, so if at least some of
you used the blackboard, that would be wonderful. I understand that some
topics are more amenable to this treatment than others. 

If you have any questions, please let me know. Thanks again. 

-- Matthias
