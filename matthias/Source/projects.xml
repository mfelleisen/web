    I have two personal, intertwined research goals: learning how to
    design programs systematically and creating a language that helps me
    express my thoughts.
   </p>

   <p>
    My first goal is to discover <em>how to design programs, components,
    and programming systems systematically.</em> I don't know any other way
    to understand design than to program and re-program and re-re-program
    small and large programs.  As I am getting to understand what happens,
    I am writing things down in <a class="ax" href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/HtDP2e/index.html"><cite>How to Design
    Programs</cite></a>, <cite>How to Design Components</cite> and
    <cite>How to Design Systems,</cite> ordinary text books at first glance but a second look will pay off. 
One day I may distill the
    ideas in to a small little book called <cite>How to Design</cite>.

    My second goal is to design a programming language that supports the
    programming styles needed for my first
    goal. <a class="ax" href="http://racket-lang.org">Racket</a> is the evolving
    subject of this project. I recently had a chance to lead-author
    <a class="ax" href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/racket/pubs/#manifesto"><cite>the Racket
    Manifesto</cite></a>, which spells out my perspective on this 20-year-old and
    on-going project. Please read the paper if you want to know what
    the Racket project is all about.

<p>With my current and former students I work on a variety of projects in
  support of the Racket project:
<ul>
<li>the transition from untyped scripts to typed programs, with 
 <a class="ax" href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/asumu/">Asumu Takikawa</a> and
 <a class="ax" href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/samth/">Sam Tobin-Hochstadt (Indiana University)</a>;
plus
 <a class="ax" href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/types/">Ben Greenmann</a> and
 <a class="ax" href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/stchang/">Stephen Chang (PhD '15)</a> 
who are exploring an alternative approach (see <a href="http://prl.ccs.neu.edu/gtp/">Gradual Typing Across the Spectrum</a>)
</li>

<li>component mechanisms and behavioral software contracts, with   
 <a class="ax" href="http://people.seas.harvard.edu/~chrdimo/">Christos Dimoulas (Harvard)</a> 
and
 <a class="ax" href="http://www.eecs.northwestern.edu/~robby/">Robby Findler (Northwestern)</a>
</li>

<li>improving macro technology for the design of domain-specific language, with 
 <a class="ax" href="http://www.cs.utah.edu/~ryan/">Ryan Culpepper (PhD '10)</a> 
and
 <a class="ax" href="http://www.cs.utah.edu/~mflatt/">Matthew Flatt (Utah)</a>
 </li>

<li>compiler and IDE tools, with 
<a class="ax" href="http://leifandersen.net">Leif Andersen</a>
and
<a class="ax" href="http://users.eecs.northwestern.edu/~stamourv/">Vincent
  St-Amour (Northwestern)</a>
</li>

<li>and reduction semantics, with 
 <a class="ax" href="http://http://www.ece.northwestern.edu/~robby/">Robby
 Findler (Northwestern)</a> and
and
 <a class="ax" href="http://www.cs.utah.edu/~mflatt/">Matthew Flatt (Utah)</a>.
</li>

</ul>
 In addition, <a class="ax" href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/tonyg/">Tony
 Garnock-Jones</a> and I are working on a functional framework for
 programming and reasoning about distributed and interactive graphical
 programs, a generalization of my <a class="ax" href="http://docs.racket-lang.org/teachpack/2htdp2htdp.html"><tt>2htdp</tt>
 library for Racket</a>.  This provides me with a personal "playground" for
 exploring and testing all of the above in practice.
