<h4>On Programming:</h4>

<p>
 A little learning is a dangerous thing. 
 <i>Alexander Pope, quoted by Peter Norvig in
 <a href="http://www.norvig.com/21-days.html">Teach Yourself Programming in
 Ten Years</a></i>
</p>

<h4>On Education:</h4>

<p>
 Whenever a textbook is written of real educational worth, you may be quite
 certain that some reviewer will say that it will be difficult to teach
 from it. Of course it will be difficult to teach from it. If it were easy,
 the book ought to be burned; for it cannot be educational. <i>Alfred
 Whitehead, The Aims of Education</i>
</p>

<p> 
 It is a striking fact that in the complex world of education ... personal
 experience and ideology are frequently relied on to make policy
 choices. In no other field is the research base so inadequate and so
 little used. <i>National Research Council, 1999</i>
