 <p>
   February 2011: We have decided to provide the
   <a href="HtDC/htdc.pdf">draft of "How to Design Classes" (pdf)</a> on an
   "as is" basis for now. You are free to download and print it.
 </p>

 <p>
   Since we may occasionally fix typos and add material, we recommend that
   you do not copy the file. Instead, link to it. 
 </p>

 <p>
   Warning: If we decide to publish the book after all, it is likely that
   the publisher will ask us to remove this version of the book from the
   web.
