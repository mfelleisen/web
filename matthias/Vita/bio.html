<p>
 Matthias Felleisen is currently a Trustee Professor at Northeastern
 University. He joined its College of Computer and Information Science in
 2001, after a 14-year career at Rice University in Houston with long and
 short sabbaticals at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh and
 &Eacute;cole Normale Sup&eacute;rieure in Paris. He received his PhD from
 Daniel P. Friedman in 1987.
</p>

<p>
Felleisen's research career consists of two distinct periods. For the
 first, he focused on the semantics of programming languages and its
 applications. His work on operational semantics has become one of the
 standard working methods in programming languages. For the second,
 Felleisen and his research group (PLT) developed a novel introductory
 curriculum plus support software to run a nation-wide outreach K12
 project. The curriculum uses methods from functional programming to teach
 systematic design and problem solving. The work on the support software has produced a novel
 functional programming language, called Racket, and an IDE (DrRacket) that
 can be tailored to the curriculum.  For Felleisen and his team, the
 construction of a large, realistic software application has posed many
 interesting and challenging research problems in programming languages,
 component programming, software contracts, and software engineering.
</p>

<p>
Over the past 20 years, Felleisen has published close to 100 research papers in
 scientific journals, conferences, and magazines. In addition, he has
 co-authored six books, including <i>How to Design Programs</i>;
 <i>The Little LISPer</i> (now called <i>The Little Schemer</i>),
 which, at the age of 40, is one of the oldest continuously published books
 in the field; and <i>Semantics Engineering</i>, his most recent book on
 techniques for developing and maintaining the semantics of a programming
 language. In 2013, he also published <i>Realm of Racket</i> with eight
 undergraduate co-authors, graduates of his <i>Program by Design</i> course. 
</p>

<p>
For his research on programming languages, Felleisen was inducted as an 
ACM Fellow in 2006 and received ACM SIGPLAN's Lifetime Achievement Award in
2012. Also in 2012, his paper on software contracts was picked as the most influential ICFP 2002 publication.

For his educational outreach, ACM honored Felleisen with the Karl
V. Karlstrom Award in 2010. ACM SIGCSE named Felleisen Outstanding
Educator of the Year in 2011.  

Felleisen has delivered keynote addresses at many major programming
language conferences, including POPL, ECOOP, ICFP as well as the 
Symposium on Computer Science Education.
