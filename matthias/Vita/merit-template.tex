\begin{document}
\maketitle

This template is designed to allow each faculty member to report on his or her
activities for the calendar year \reportyear.  The headings are designed to
include most typical activity, not to create rigid categories.  Feel free to
delete any subsections that do not apply to you, or to add additional
subsections if needed to describe your activities.

Turn this template into a report by editing the line \verb|\def\name{Mitchell
Wand}| above to contain your name, and by deleting all the explanatory
material, that is, any line in the file that does not start with a backslash
(\verb/\/).  You can then process the report with LaTeX.

Along with this report, please include copies of all papers submitted or
published during the year, grant proposals, etc.

Also, please include a copy of your report {\bf {from last year}}.  While
Merit ratings will be based on this year's activities only, a copy of last
year's report will give the committee additional context to enable us to read
your report in a more informed manner.

\section{Research}

\subsection{Summary}

Give here a brief summary of your research activities for the year.

\subsection{Books in Print}

List books, etc.  

In each of these subsections, list each entry as a separate paragraph.  You
can use \verb|\begin{enumerate} ... \end{enumerate}| if you like, but this is
not necessary.

Feel free to add additional subsections if there is any category we've
missed.   This goes for teaching and service as well.

\subsection{Journal Articles (Published)}

of Prog. Lang.\/} (1988), 204--218.

``Type Inference for Record Concatenation and Multiple Inheritance,''

Add additional subsections as necessary to describe your activities.

\section{Service}

\subsection{Summary}

If appropriate, describe your major service contributions during the year.

\subsection{College Committees}
