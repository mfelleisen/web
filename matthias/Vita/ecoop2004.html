Titel: Functional Classes, Functional Objects

Matthias Felleisen

Abstract: At first glance, object-oriented programming has little or nothing in
 common with functional programming. One grew out of the procedural
 tradition, providing means for representing real-world objects and
 mechanisms for encapsulating state.  Computing proceeds via method
 calls. The other is a radical departure from conventional programming. It
 emphasizes a(n almost) purely mathematical approach. Programmers design
 systems of algebraic datatypes and functions, and a computation is the
 evaluation of an expression. Still, nobody can overlook the similarities
 of the two approaches considering the development of design patterns and
 notions of effective object-oriented programming practices.

In my talk, I will compare and contrast the two ideas of programming and
 programming language design. I will present and defend the thesis that
 good object-oriented programming heavily ``borrows'' from functional
 programming and that the future of object-oriented programming is to study
 functional programming and language design even more.
