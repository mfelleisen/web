Custom Domains

First you'll need to create a file named CNAME in your blog's source:

echo 'your-domain.com' >> source/CNAME
# OR
echo 'www.your-domain.com' >> source/CNAME
Next, you’ll need to visit your domain registrar or DNS host and add a record for your domain name.

For a sub-domain like www.example.com you would simply create a CNAME
record pointing at charlie.github.io.. 

If you are using a top-level domain like example.com, you must use an A
record pointing to 192.30.252.153 or 192.30.252.154. 

Do not use a CNAME record with a top-level domain! It can have adverse side
effects on other services like email. Many DNS services will let you set a
CNAME on a TLD, even though you shouldn’t. Remember that it may take up to
a full day for DNS changes to propagate, so be patient.
